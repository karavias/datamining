aS"After being on YouTube for 2 years now, I know how much hate people can \ngive to me when reading these kinds of comments but maybe someone may be \nnicer. My dream is to be an actor and i like to dance in public, but i cant \nget in performing school, and i just got 1,443 subs, which is pretty \nimpressive to me, but I'll never get noticed with these numbers. If someone \nwould have the heart just to give this a thumbs up and spend all of 30 \nseconds watching a vid, it would mean the world. Thank you all"

aS'Hey do you play on xbox live, if so what your gamertag :)'
p919
aS'Sexual reproduction is not only a natural thing, but also required for the \nsurvival of the species.The reason we don\'t have sex on the street with \nstrangers is because that\'s the way our minds have been developed. Humans \nare also animals. I don\'t see animals going around in public raping other \nanimals. You think of it like a "bad thing", but that\'s just your point of \nview. Respect other peoples\' views too.'
p920
aS'i can\'t even choose* to put sex instead of s*x because i have dignity. it\'s \nnot hard for someone like you who had her first date at 12 years old to \nlive without dignity,self respect,respect from others,without honor?? \nreally? interesting.. o_0 (xD) "Why the hell do you think dating sites \nexist?" i\'m a programmer and i assure you that the dating sites are made \nfor making lots of money into an easy way!'
p921
aS"okay, so my friend Meaghan (this is her account) and I were watching this \nvideo. As soon as 'farm ville' was mentioned that's when the laughter \nbegan. She couldn't stop laughing! I had to pause the video and take the \nlaptop off her lap due to her choking. To all those viewers, WARNING this \nvideo can kill people c: -Ellie<3"
p922
aS'There are whores everywhere, so really that\'s a legit inference, but for a \nman who first dated at age 22, you can\'t even put sex instead of s*x? And \nanimals don\'t go paroling the "streets" for a mate, they make for life.'

aS'I can replay this everyday...so funny..'
p925
aS"2nd comment just because the americans are soooo unserious about \nrelationstips, soo depraved, so ville.. doesn't mean that everyone in world \nis like that! :p for americans (i mean especially at guys) it's normal to \nhave in life around 20 partners/lovers. what the fuck!? even worst than the \ndogs!! the american guys and the majority of american girls are a disgrace \nfor human race!!

p929
aS"Awesome to see your attitude towards your relationship!, because it's \nreally rare to see now. I'm finding less people have any moral standards \nand trying to convince everyone it's ''normal'' -Sighs- lolol"
p930
aS'2nd comment "you can date all you want and no one gives a fuck" -> BUT I \nGIVE A F*CK! i\'d rather kill myself than losing my dignity, self respect or \nhonor into that ville way! do you know? i pity the people like you who \nlosed their dignity. i\'m european.i don\'t say that my country is perfect \n(in fact i pity and despise the ville people from my country too) i\'m not \neven religious.i\'m spiritual. the martial arts changed my life into this \n"pure" way. i believe in perfection! i\'m a perfectionist!'

And plus, it's \nlegal to have sex in my state at age 13 and under because they really can't \ncharge you for that.

aS'k i\'m not gonna reply any further if you reply back to me because i\'ll look \nlike one of those youtube fags that get into stupid arguments, but let me \nclarify a few things: 1. i don\'t live in the us. 2. everywhere in the world \npeople get boyfriends or girlfriends before 18, no matter where... 3. i \ndon\'t even have a girlfriend, so don\'t say "kids like you" 4. 14 and 15 \nyear olds giving birth are absolutely everywhere, so you must be like 9 \nyears old if you don\'t know this... that is all'

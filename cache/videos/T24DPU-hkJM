p14
aS"Most kids go to college right when they are out in highschool. Me?

aS'College is a huge scam. I once hired this college-degree certified man that \nhas studied the history of architecture and passed every requirement from \ncollege to fix houses. I hired him for 400$ seeing as he was EXTREMELY \nqualified. He went over to my house and took 3 damn hours fixing some water \ntubes under my house. In only 2 months, they started leaking again. I then \nsaid, forget that, so I decided to hire an "uneducated" Mexican to fix it \nfor 150$. He took 1 hour to fix it. It\'s been 5 years and I have no \nproblems with the water pipes any more since the Mexican fixed it.

It doesn't matter if \nyou have a master's degree or a bachelor's degree, employers are looking \nfor hardworking ass people not those that would just ramble on about how \nthey should be getting a higher job. Education isn't a joke, learn while \nyou can at a trade school or something like that. You know what is also \nsickening is that people force you to go to College because they think \nyou'll be mentally retarded if you don't and besides you know how many \npeople change their major which is why they are in debt, we don't know what \nwe want at 18 years of age...we just tag a long with everyone else.

I am going into my Junior year of high \nschool here in the U.S., and I'm wanting to go into Game Design. Now the \nmore I look at going to university or college, I get disinterested, because \nof 2 reasons (and maybe more but I can think of them) \n\n#1- Take a whole bunch of useless classes that my career doesn't really \nneed.\n\n#2- This video pointed out that it costs a lot, but I didn't know it was \nTHAT high.\n\nNow considering this, I am looking towards just creating an Indie team and \ndeveloping apps for mobile and then work up from there. Maybe create a \ncompany if I get enough people. No I do not want to travel abroad, want to \nstay close to my family, sorry :| Well thx in advance! ^_~\xef\xbb\xbf"

This is why I think employers are fuckin stupid. \nThis is my experience with almost all management I've had in past jobs: A \nkid who just graduated college gets a job as a manager because he has a \ndegree, and he doesn't know how to do anything because he lacks experience. \nExperience should be the #1 thing employers look at, not degrees.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p318
aS"In Germany you get the money for college(the amount depends on how much \nmoney your family earns) but also have to pay half of it back. And even \nwith that money you propably can't effort to go to private universities and \ntherefore need to visit the public ones which are much cheaper. \nThat's why I wasn't able to study what I wanted to.

p457
aS'This video is very well made, though it plays to one of the greatest \nmisconceptions in American education: universities are job-training centers \nthat are designed to give you skills necessary to find a good job. Students \nattend university in order to learn these skills and get good jobs, which \nis the university\'s mission.\n\nReality: universities are guilds of scholars who pursue knowledge for \nknowledge\'s sake, through scholarly inquiry in the case of the humanities \nand the formal sciences and through empirical research in the case of the \nnatural and social sciences. Students join this guild to become scholars \nand learn this knowledge for the sake of learning. Whether or not that \nknowledge helps you find a job is almost irrelevant. This is why there is a \ngeneral education requirement at all universities, because part of being a \ntrue scholar is having general knowledge about all fields of academics, not \njust your specialty.\n\nUniversities were never intended to provide basic job-training. In fact, \nthey\'re downright terrible at it. The only job training at universities \nthat they actually do well is high level knowledge based jobs like law and \nmedicine. America is the only post-industrial nation in the world with this \nbelief which is we have such a high college attendance rate (Only 30% of \nGerman high school graduates enter a 4 year college/university after \ngraduation, compared to over 70% in the US). This is despite the fact that \nEuropean universities have far lower tuition rates (most expensive is \nBritain, but even their the tuition to schools like Oxford and Cambridge is \nless than most community colleges in the US).\n\nIf you want to receive job training after high school, don\'t go to a \nuniversity. Go to a community college, apprenticeship, vocational school, \netc.\n\nP.S. I am not a liberal arts major trying to justify my decision to pick a \n"useless" major. I\'m a quantitative biology major planning on getting a \nPh.D. then go into research.\xef\xbb\xbf'

You need a total of 136 credits to graduate, meaning, you have \nto be averaging 17 credits a semester at least, but in those 17 credits you \ncould be taking 10 credit courses that are pre-reqs and you can\'t take the \npre-reqs without a co-req which also has a pre-req cause it\'s the school\'s \nway of keeping you there for 5 years instead of 4.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p646
aS"I quit community college after 1 semester. College is a big, giant bubble \nthat when it pops, it will mean NOTHING if you have a PhD. Just like the \nhousing bubble but with jobs. My old grandparents are like 'but you NEED a \ncollege degree' and I'm like 'but I NEED to be debt free, independent and \nself employed, because NOBODY will hire me for ANYTHING, regardless if I \nhave that special piece of paper or not.'\n\nThe middle class is dead, and when the music stops, those who are self \nemployed will be the BEST off. People born before 1990 just don't get it. \nExcept when you know your uncle who WORKS at a college AS A PROFESSOR, and \nhe is NOT sending his kids to college, because HE KNOWS!\xef\xbb\xbf"

I \nenrolled at the West campus instead because West was more of a trade \nschool. To top it off, I went at night because I realized that was the best \ntime to hang around people who WANTED to learn. The people there were \nrelaxed, mature, and not uptight.

So if the only income you \nhave is a part time job, your bill will be like 30-60 bucks a month. Then, \nYour debt gets forgiven If you haven't payed it back in like 20 or so \nyears. So, Basically this means loans aren't as bad. I'm sure taking \nadvantage of it. Hey, they're ripping me off, so I' doing the same. Off \ncourse your bill will be higher if you make more money, but it will still \nbe proportional to your income. This is only for government loans. Besides, \nthe student loan bubble will collapse soon anyway, and your debt will be \nforgiven lmao.

aS'1:13 looks like Zeddie Little\xef\xbb\xbf'
p902
aS"truth is, university's can make it much easier to find a job. HOWEVER this \nonly happens if students are proactive (something that, I'll admit, \nuniversities do a bad job of telling you when you apply/enroll).  if you're \nnot looking for internships after your first year (although doing so as a \nfirst year is super ideal), you're falling farther and farther behind in \nthe job market because most people end up working full-time for the \ncompanies they interned at.  also, in addition to providing students with \ncareer counseling and job fairs/seminars/info sessions, universities allow \nfor students to join student organizations that offer them the chance to \nstart networking, like academic organizations, sports clubs, and (dare I \nsay it) fraternities and sororities.  WHO you know is equally as important \nas WHAT you know (if not more so). a competition to get a job between two \nequally qualified people will probably go to the one that has the most in \ncommon with the interviewer/selector (not to mention their interviewing \nskills).  To summarize: if you put in the necessary work both inside and \noutside the classroom, you should be just fine.\n\nUnfortunately, this is lost on young people, partly because of the culture \nof negativity surrounding higher education (which seems like it mostly \ncomes from people who chose not to go to or dropped out of college), and \nalso because of the average high-school grad's expectations of college: \nhaving fun,drinking and doing as much drugs as you want while meeting new \npeople to have unrealistic amounts of sex with.  the national lampoon \nmovies certainly don't help with this, neither do the universities \nthemselves given how they advertise the college experience.\n\nanyways, that's just the opinion of a college student at a tiny liberal \narts school smackdab in central ohio.  i'm sure some people have much \ndifferent perspectives than I do, and may be more informed, but ultimately \nyour attitudes about college are informed and even biased by your own \nlimited experience. aaaaaaaand end opinion.\xef\xbb\xbf"

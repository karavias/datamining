aS"Oh Sensei of Survival...how I wished I had viewed these videos before my \nexpedition into the zubzero Yonder!. Unfortunately I watched a channel with \nan English chap that gave advice about being lost: 1) get as far from your \n'lost' position as soon as possible within as short an amount of time as \npossible... and 2) to get to an impossible location...because some unseen \nenemy is chasing you and you need to be at the drop point!! ASAP bro. \nSnowshoes...do it. \n\nThus in my case following that advice would have been putting myself in a \ngrave amount of danger...given that staying put would have been the safest \noption. Why? Because I had my basic supplies and emergency kit on hand \nbecause...just because you do that shit....seriously. edc fellas. \nShelter...fire starting ability. \n\nI love and support this video because it sheds light on a serious issue in \na comedic sense. There is a big difference to 'extraction/drop point' \nmilitary survival and everyday woods and normal urban survival. Both are \nvalid...its a shame Bear couldn't just do it for real or at least say it \nwasn't for real..and state the intended purpose compared to real survival \nscenarios was in stark contrast to extraction scenarios...instead..mmmm'ok?\xef\xbb\xbf"

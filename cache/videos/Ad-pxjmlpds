aS'People use to hate Justin Bieber because of his girly voice.\nNobody cares about that anymore.\nHe is not a bad singer, but I hate him so much mainly because he used to be \na role model for children but not anymore. He has permanent tattoos now. He \nalso does drugs and vandalizes.\nNobody wants their children to do that (well, most people).\nHe\'s also really conceded and a jerk to his fans.\nI would like him more if he was a "PROPER" children\'s role model.\n\xef\xbb\xbf'

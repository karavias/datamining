If he would \nactually mention an existing country it wouldn't make any more sense, and \nhis goal wasn't even to make sense at all, quite the opposite. My point is, \nI'm sure he knows that Yugoslavia isn't a country anymore and he just \nhappened to use the name for comedic purposes. Hell, if he said the Soviet \nUnion instead, it would pretty much have the exact same effect."

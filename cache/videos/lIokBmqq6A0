aS"TO ALL NIGAHIGA FANS! Simply saying that RWJ has more\xef\xbb\xbf subscribers and \nasking for help isnt going to boost nigahiga's subs. He doesn't beg, and \nneither should we. So what\xef\xbb\xbf should we do instead? Like, favorite, comment, \nhis videos, and feature his videos on your channel if you can. The\xef\xbb\xbf way \nhe'll get more subscribers is by more people being exposed to him. Are you \nwith me?

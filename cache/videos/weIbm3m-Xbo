aS'Actually, the length of a second can change from one planet to another, \ndepending on how fast the planet spins, if you take in consideration the \nRelativity Theory. But that still would be able to turn 2 minutes and \nfifty-six seconds in two hundred and and fifty six minutes =P'

p834
aS'what happened to sean, and the girl it was awesome then!!!'
p835
aS'Each day on Saturn takes 10.2 Earth hours. A year on Saturn takes 29.46 \nEarth years; it takes 29.46 Earth years for Saturn to orbit the sun once. \nEach day on Uranus takes 17.9 Earth hours. A year on Uranus takes 84.07 \nEarth years; it takes 84.07 Earth years for Uranus to orbit the sun once. '
p836
aS'Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun in our Solar System. It has a long \ndaytime (which lasts 58.65 Earth days or almost an entire Mercurian year, \nwhich is 88 days long) Venus rotates VERY slowly. Each day on Venus takes \n243 Earth days. A year on Venus takes 224.7 Earth days. It takes 224.7 \nEarth days for Venus to orbit the sun once. The same side of Venus always \nfaces Earth when the Earth and Venus are closest together. '

aS'wtf 1:40 lol o.O'
p851
aS'how did you make an account on youtube if you are a pureblood??? I am still \nconfused... '
p852
aS"Each day on Earth takes 23.93 hours (that is, it takes the Earth 23.93 \nhours to rotate around its axis once - this is a sidereal day). Each year \non Earth takes 365.26 Earth days (that is, it takes the Earth 365.26 days \nto orbit the Sun once). The Earth's rotation is slowing down very slightly \nover time, about one second every 10 years. Each day on Mars takes 1.03 \nEarth days (24.6 hours). A year on Mars takes 687 Earth days; it takes this \nlong for Mars to orbit the sun once. "
p853
aS'whats the song at 1:36 the slow one'
p854
aS'Funny!'

p856
aS'Ummm wtf happened to the coments that are all "good job yo" now its all \nwell planets do this blabla bla SPARKELS GLITER AND PONEYS blablabla'
p857
aS"rotation is like when the the spinning of the planets on their own axis \nwhile revolution is when the planets spin around the sun, and it's not just \nplanets, it could be defined on anything, like when an object spinning on \nitself and an object spinning around another object ^-^ hehe no prob, i \ndont get why people curse in an argument, maybe they cant accept defeat or \nsomething haha "
p858
aS'TROLOLOLOLOL!!!!!'
p859
aS'This guy thinks time goes slower and faster on other planets, which is \nbullshit, just ignore him :3'
p860
aS"Let me break it down for you, a DAY is the time it takes for a planet to \nperform 1 revolution, other planets spin at other speeds, so they have \nlonger or shorter days. Years are relative to the distance from the \nsun/star, years on pluto are much longer because it is much further away \nfrom the sun, while seconds, minutes, hours, etc aren't relative, therefore \n1 second here and 1 second on mars are the same."
p861
aS"I didn't know they had Science teachers in Elementary School"
p862
aS'Love the sound of the coquis in the background.'

aS'hey dumb ass i am right time is different....why the fuck do you think the \ndays are longer, i mean in what logic does that even work out, and what \ngrade are you in like 2??? seriously...learn your shit'
p871
aS'If Harry Potter were Asian,,,,'
p872
aS'omfg you are so stupid, i even asked my science teacher, just go and live \nin your little fantasy world then......'
p873
aS'ur idea is correct but i believe a day is the time it takes for a planet to \nperform 1 rotation, not revolution xD haha, just a friendly correction ^-^'
p874
aS'1:37 WTF'
p875
aS"Nope, time doesn't go slower, years are slower because they are relative to \nthe distance from the sun, seconds, minutes and hours aren't because they \nare persistent throughout the universe, so don't go calling me a dumbass so \nfast, dumbass -.-"
p876

p10
aS'Blacks think that we have forgotten the Knoxville horror, in which 5 blacks \nabducted 2 WHITE college students, boyfriend and girlfriend, raped both of \nthem until their orifices were damaged, poured bleach down their throats, \nshot them and then sliced them into bits! YOU THINK WE HAVE FORGOTTEN, \nBLACKS? YOU FUCKERS WILL PAY ALONGSIDE WITH THE MUSLIMS.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'whats the "n" word?\xef\xbb\xbf'

p15
aS"It was a joke it really wasn't for real lol\xef\xbb\xbf"
p16
aS'A lot of people don\'t understand the term "racist" when they use it. They \nassume it means anything racially insensitive, but that\'s not true. It\'s \ndefined as "an adverse judgement made without looking at the facts". \nTherefor, using the N word can never be racist. It can be offensive, but \nnot racist. Racist would be like saying "Oh, that black guy probably stole \nthat car". I\'ve never liked Justin Bieber, but I get upset when people \nignorantly throw around the word "racist".\xef\xbb\xbf'
p17
aS"My first real rant in a while.. \nI know I may get a lot of hate for this opinion, but I'm just being honest \nabout how I feel about the situation! Let me know what you guys think!\n\xef\xbb\xbf"
p18
aS'The definition of Racism is judging someone by color or race of someone\'s \nskin. \nSaying the \'N\' word randomly isn\'t racist. It\'s just calling a black person \nout. If Justin Bieber said something like: "Black people are stupid." , \nthen he\'d be considered a racist.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p19
aS'The lesson of the day here is: Saying racist jokes does not make you a \nracist person.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p20
aS'I am in no way defending him but he is certainly not a racist. I\'m sure if \nyou think about it you\'ve have said a racist joke while you were younger, \nit\'s similar to people saying "that\'s so gay" I\'m sure we all said that \nwhen we were 13 because we didn\'t understand the degree to what it actually \nmeant and how offensive it is to the LGBT community. He does not express \nany prejudice to African Americans at all. If you can sit here and tell me \nyou\'ve never made a racist joke while you were younger fine sit there and \njudge, but if you have made any racial joke to any group of people in your \nlife, no matter how innocent you thought it was or how many people you told \nthe joke to, do not label someone as a racist because you don\'t like them.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p21
aS'Funny how most of the people agreeing with you is either White or Asian. \nAnd for you to have the nerve to compare social media networking sites \n"about sections" to Racism/Slavery shows how much of an idiot and ignorant \nperson you are. Racism/Slavery are wayyy more intense than your social \nmedia comparison. I\'m guessing most of your friends are White and you have \nto impress them. I don\'t. Having a bunch of black friends, doesn\'t make you \nless or not racist. Donald Sterling, had a BUNCH of Black people working \nunder him, did that make him less racist??? NO. Justin Beiber started \nhanging around Black people as a precaution, just in case those videos \nsurface. One can\'t JUST stop being racist. You can suppress it or \nCamouflage it, but it\'s still there. Fuck you and your followers. You\'ll \nnever know what it\'s like to Live as A Black Person, ass kisser. \nUnsubscribed.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p22
aS'Being a racist is when you prevent someone else from doing something based \non race. Sounds familiar? Yes, the fact that people actually think that \nnigger should only be used by African Americans IS racist. The more people \nemphasize this word and evade it by saying "the n-word" as if everyone were \n7 year old kids makes that word become sensitive to people. There are \nbigger problems out there such as our continuous and reckless use of fossil \nfuels or multi-drug resistant diseases that are evolving resulting in the \ndeaths of thousands. We could be facing a mass extinction in less than 50 \nyears and what are people thinking about? whether some person that was not \nblack said the word nigger. This society continues to surprise me with its \nstupidity and severe lack of any common sense.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p23
aS'In my intire 12 years I\'ve never, ever said or did something racists. I \nhave always ignored every black joke (until vine became a thing, but I\'ve \nnever agreed to anything or repeated it) I\'ve heard as long as I new what \nthat was (so maybe 4 years.) I\'ve never been called raciest (except for \nwhen I was 5 and some dude (a father to a friend in my class) called me \nraciest because I didn\'t have the pencil crayon I usually used to colour \npeople, and my friend (the one with the dad) suggested to use brown becomes \nthat\'s a colour of people in the world, like my friend(still the same one.) \nhis dad saw it and got angry. (mean really, I was 5 i didn\'t know what that \nwas. I was drawing a picture for school) I seriously think that his dad was \na jerk about it, he could of said "why did u use that colour?" Really \npeople calm down, kids r not going to get that. So basically I\'m one person \nwho\'s never been raciest,(I am 12 so maybe just give it time) but this vid \nis 3 months old so nobody\'s going to really read this.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p24
aS'I\'m 13 and I highly doubt that I\'ll ever regret saying that "Yoda in star \nwars episode 7 will be played by Lindsay Lohan" on facebook\xef\xbb\xbf'
p25
aS"Bieber Racist? Lmfao!\nThe majority of his music nowadays is appealing to hip hop heads and rnb \nlovers. Almost all of his collabs are also with black peeps. No ways Bizzle \nis racist, he was just caught out on what ALL of us have said before.\nOn another note, can someone please insult me with a white 'ni&&a' word? \nThe word Ni&&a has completely last it's hatred meaning. It's been empowered \ntremendously and I think all Blacks should be proud of this. I'm finding it \nso difficult to not call my black homies 'ni&&as's....so hard!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p26
aS"NIGAhiga\n\nRyan's racist..\xef\xbb\xbf"
p27
aS"Im sure a lot of us make racist jokes or act a little racist everyone in a \nwhile. Everyone acts a little racist but we're not famous so no one cares. \nI hate jb, but the dude Was a kid having fun and telling jokes.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p28
aS'Nigahiga is a pretty racist name just now hes so popular he pronounces it \nneega heega because he didnt intend to get popular and make a living with \nyoutube\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'This is my first time hearing about this\xef\xbb\xbf'
p41
aS'I\'m not saying Justin Bieber is racist, but the whole "he has black \nfriends, he can\'t be racist" argument is complete shit. It\'s like saying \nHitler didn\'t hate Jews because his wife was a Jew. A little more extreme, \ngranted, but hanging out with black people or people of a different race \ndoesn\'t automatically prevent you from being racist.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I\xc2\xb4m tired of people calling EVERYTHING racist. "I don\'t like black coffee". \nRACIST! "I prefer white dogs" RACIST. "Avril Laving posted a hello kitty \nsong" RACIST!\n\n Relax. Not everything is racist. People need to learn how to take a JOKE. \nOnly racist people see everything as racist. People who aren\'t FORGET about \nraces so when they say something like "Ryan is yellow" ,after the fact, \n they would realise "Oh no, that sounded racist!"\xef\xbb\xbf'
p49
aS"I'm proud to be asian - said asian.\nI'm proud to be black - said negro.\nI'm proud to be white - said racist.\n\n__\nAmerica... lol\xef\xbb\xbf"
p50
aS'A joke isn\'t an excuse for you to say racist (or sexist, homophobic) things \nand get away with it. There is no excuse for racism. It doesn\'t matter what \n"you mean" by it, when you say it, you are perpetuating the oppression and \nnormalize the discrimination. You make it ok for other racist people to \nsaid the same thing, joking or not. Make the suffering of a group of people \ninto something trivial, something to laugh at.\nAlso the excuse "He hang out with black people so he can not be racist" is \nlame, I thought people would know by now.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p51
aS'Or African-Americans try to find the slightest thing so they can say \nracist. Okay, we were slave once, that was a long time ago, there are some \nracist people in the world, but do you really have to over react to every \nsmall thing... I don\'t care about racism, anybody can call me the "n" word \nand I won\'t get offended. Sometimes I even tell other people to call me it, \njust for fun. Lighten up people. Stop trying to find someone or Somthing to \ncall racist!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p52
aS"Literally how can he be a recist? Usher is black and yes he treats him LIKE \nA BROTHER. I'm a fan o u Ryan i didnt finish the video. I'm really pissed \noff. Ugh. People dont understand him. And yes i am a Belieber. For 6 years. \nIm still here standing for Justin. Media will do everything to ruin \nsomeones life. Wtf? I cant believe this. Ryan i think amma giving this \nvideo a dislike cause i got offense. Pls be sensitive on people's feelings. \n\xef\xbb\xbf"
p53
aS'Bro do u breathe??? Haha\xef\xbb\xbf'
p54
aS"I'm from Singapore!! I went to your love show 2 years ago I think in \nsentosa wavehouse. Should be 2 years ago yep\xef\xbb\xbf"
p55
aS'the word "racist" has really been desensitized and flung around so much for \na long time now, like being an idiot is being an idiot and if youre an \nidiot you should get punched in the face. But just because you don\'t have \nwits doesn\'t mean you think your race is better than another and then \ndiscriminate against them. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p56
aS'racism is just as bad in the form of a joke!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p57
aS"0:43 Even if you COULDN'T care less?\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'The thing from the end is actually in the beginning of the video\n\xef\xbb\xbf'
p59
aS"I doubt a kid who's only friends are black, role model is black and is \ntrying to BE black could really be a racist.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p60
aS"don't think Ryan would say the same thing if Bieber made racist jokes about \nJapanese people (or Asian people, in general) instead.\n\nracism IS racism whether it's in humour or a serious statement. don't \nexcuse it dude, you'll only be encouraging other racists.\n\nyes, argue that he may not be a racist now, but at 15 he must have been a \nracist (whether intentionally or not) to have joked about racism (something \nthat is really really serious and should never be joked about).\n\ni do think we should focus on the fact that (hopefully) Bieber must have \nsince learned to be more respectful to not use the N-word. i guess that's a \ngood thing, which people tend not to pay attention to in favour of bashing \nJB because nobody (other than the Beliebers) likes him.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Dear Ryan,Can u make a Skitzo video after this comment (no presh) \xef\xbb\xbf'
p67
aS'Who agrees William Travis is extremely racist?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p68
aS'Being a racist is having an opinion that the humans can be sortet into \ndifferent rases were one is better than others. Calling someone black any \nother word without meaning to insult someone, is about as racist as calling \nme a Norwegian.\n\nIt is also racist to call someone a racist because when you do, you put the \nperson in a group with other people you think is less worth or atleast you \nthink they do some bad stuff. \n\nThe reason i write this is not to defend any racist outrage but because \nalmost everyone how calls someone a racist dont even know the definition of \nracisme.\xef\xbb\xbf'

So Donald Sterrling does yet \ndoesn't deserve to be punished because I am sure everyone has said \nsomething racist in their own home. His girlfriend recorded him saying \nsomething in a private area. He wasn't in public saying it. But also the \nthings he said were wrong and should be punished but he does not deserve to \nbe punished this bad because he said this in the privacy of his own home. \nPlease do not get angry I just want to let you guys know my opinion. \nThanks!\xef\xbb\xbf"

p132
aS"Also everyone in the world is racially prejudice, but not racist. A black \nperson can't be racist due to history. No need to complain about that \neither (well some of you anyway). Racism is a system of advantage based on \nrace so white people are actually benefiting from it, but no one suffers \nmore than people of color. Also, everyone has privilege, but if you're a \ncisgender, heterosexual, white man, you have the most privilege possible. \nRemember that, when you don't understand why we're upset about racism and \nshit. #DoBetter\xef\xbb\xbf"
p133
aS'yeah, justin has been doing a lot of "inappropriate" things lately and yeah \nit\'s mostly his fault but like ryan said in this video, he said those \nthings when he was 14 or 15 years old and he it\'s NORMAL for a person that \nage to joke about things and he didn\'t know that a "private hang out" with \nhis buddies would go viral 4 years after it actually happened. So lets face \nit a lot of 19 and 20 year olds do so much more worst things than Justin \nhas, and (I\'m not trying to offend anyone) but it\'s kind of normal in the \nstates that people that age try drugs, go to parties, get arrested and \nstuff but why don\'t they get as much hate as Justin has been getting? it\'s \nbecause he\'s a celebrity, and people watch over him 24/7 waiting for him to \ndo something bad, but when he does something good, does it get all over the \nnews as much as it does when he does something bad? this is the problem \nwith everyone, we focus on the bad things people do and they get so much \ncrap for it but when they do something good no one ever notices it. he has \ndone so much good deeds for the world and yet he isn\'t given any credit for \nthat. instead he is hated by everyone who thinks they know him. also keep \nin mind that yes, he may be a celebrity but he\'s totally human too, he gets \nhurt by the mean things everyone calls him and when you think about it, for \na 20 year old he handles these things very maturely, we do not know what he \ngoes through everyday so please as much as possible try not to judge him.. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I don\'t agree that Justin Bieber should be let off the hook just because \nhis intention with the racist jokes was to entertain. You don\'t have to be \nserious about something to be offensive when saying it. I feel like he\'s \nnot racist, but really ignorant. He needs to be educated on how to not be \nan ass, that\'s for sure. I find it annoying though because he and a handful \nof others (Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, etc.) keep appropriating black culture \nand then they do shit like this. Katy Perry may not be throwing around \nslurs but her appropriation of black culture is so strong it\'s crazy. \nJustin Bieber shouldn\'t say the n-word because he doesn\'t understand the \nfull value of the term and he never can because he\'s not black. His \nprivilege as a cis-white man should be enough for him. The fact that he \nsaid it doesn\'t mean he\'s racist, but if he does it twice then someone \nneeds to speak up and tell him to get his shit together. The argument that \na word shouldn\'t be exclusive to one race is stupid. I hate it when white \npeople especially claim the argument that the n-word shouldn\'t be exclusive \nand that it\'s not fair. Uhm, I\'ve yelling about how your amount of \nprivilege is unfair compared to how much people of color have, but no one \nwants to fix that, right. *sips tea* For all white people getting offended \nby that, get over it. The term is exclusive to black people so black people \nshould be the only ones saying it. Just like how I can say "nigga" and \nidentify as "queer" because I am a queer person of color (native american \nand black :)), but it is not okay for a non-black person to say nigga or a \nstraight person to say queer because neither of those types of people were \nthere to reclaim it.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Despite that, most \nof those people would not describe themselves as homophobic because they \nhave nothing against homosexuals, they just use gay as an insult...which is \nhomophobic. So by the logic of these people, as Justin Bieber has not \nexhibited any hatred or hateful behaviour towards black people and has only \nused offensive language, that means he\'s not racist. A lot of haters need \nto practise what they preach, I personally am not a fan of Bieber but I \njust think that people need to be more aware of what they\'re accusing \npeople of and how hypocritical they are being.  \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"ok. first off. racism is a problem that will only stop when people stop \ntalking about being racist, racist acts, or showing support to certain \nraces over another. Secondly, slavery in this country was an awful act. It \nwas more gruesome and more discusting then anything i could ever imagine. \nSo if you have ancestors that we slaves or were former slaves please dont \nbe offended. But the way people thought back then is different. I \npersonally have been called racist for the reason that I'm white and my \nancestors may have had slaves. The thing is thats not who i am. Slaves in \nthe US on a commercial scale are in the past. The people you grow up with \nand deal with and deal with in your everyday lives should not be looked at \ndifferently strictly for the fact that their ancestors may have had slaves. \n\xef\xbb\xbf"

p442
aS"The problem with what Justin has said and done is, even at 12 or younger, \nkids are aware of what racist words are, from traditional media, to the \nweb, and even in school and with friends or family, kids learn early on \nwhat is ok to say and what is not. What gets me is, when people object to \nhis actions, people justify it and say, he was a kid, or just get over it. \nNow, if JB was an all around decent kid, folks might give him the benefit \nof the doubt, but when this kid behaves so poorly towards others, it makes \none think he may be racist. All the racist people I have ever met, have \ntended not to be nice people in general. The problem with telling people \nthat, its no big deal, slavery ended a long time ago, etc, is the fact \nthat, many people do experience racism and bigotry off and on even today. \nThis is why I despise any of the words racists, bigots, homophobes, etc, \nuse because, I know somewhere the last thing someone heard were those \nhatful words before being beaten to the point they end up in the hospital \nor dead. I mean, just today at a cafe I was at, a regular customer who is \nbigoted mentioned to a Black lady how bad people from India are, and then \nfollowed up with Koreans are just as bad. This dude blames everyone from \nAsians and Backs, to Gays and Lesbians, and people from the Middle East, \nand even the government and Obama for the fact that, he is in a bad \nfinancial place, that he won't seek out the help he needs. This dude is \njust like the bigoted people we had in my family, till they passed on. \nThese hateful ways are still passed on to some of the younger generation, \nby hateful parents. I mean, 20% of folks in the south still feel \ninterracial marriage is wrong and that it should be illegal. If we forget \nthe past, we are doomed to repeat it, which is why we see fascism growing \nin places like Greece, where the populous who is tired of a collapsed \neconomy, joblessness, etc, are complacent about the rise of this fascism \nbecause, the fascist party is providing food, some health care, etc, only \nto Greek citizens while scapegoating Jews, Gays, etc, as the cause of the \neconomic crisis. Meanwhile the same fascist group is attacking the Jews, \nGays, and even foreigners, along with anyone who can't prove their A greek \ncitizen. If allowed to gain power, their leader has already said he \nwelcomes the firing up of ovens. I hear bigotry mainly from the right, who \nblame everything on minorities, the poor, gays, etc, while not taking \nresponsibility for deregulating Wall Street which is what caused the \neconomic collapse in the first place. I mean, its like that popular \nyoutuber who recently got heat for saying some homophobic stuff a year or \nso ago. He had previously posted so w racist tweets and other stuff which, \nhe got a lot of heat for and was forced to apologize for. One would have \nthought that experience would have been a wake up call, but a year later, \nhe posted the latest video. Justin Bieber is likewise establishing a \npattern of behavior, so when he does something out of anger because the \npaparazzi have hounded him all day as they did Johana Hill, the day before \nhis premiere of 22 Jump Street, just so they could sell papers, the public \nwill be far less forgiving than they were with Johana Hill because, Justin \nhas demonstrated a pattern of being an Ass, saying bigoted things, etc, so \nfolks will tend to think its the same situation again. Just look at how \nlong it has taken Mel Gibson to make it back into a major movie, after he \nwent of his two racist tirades. When all those young female Bieber girls \nbegin to grow up and have their own kids, they may not think he is such a \ngood influence anymore. I don't put all the blame on JB as, its obvious \nthere is a major lack of proper adult supervision in his upbringing after \nhitting it big. We have seen other celebrities who likewise had a lack of \nproper parenting self destruct, hopefully someone can talk some since into \nthe kid before, we see him have a bad car wreck, OD, or get someone else \nkilled. Since he is a role model, his actions do influence young folks, so \nkeep that in mind too. \xef\xbb\xbf"

I make Asian jokes while my mother is half Asian. I make White \njokes and both my parents have that in them. I make Black jokes but do I \nhate/discriminate against Black folks? No, I have them too in my bloodline. \nMy father always told me it's healthy to make fun of your own race \nsometimes. The Black kids in my school all make Black jokes in front of the \nwhole class, why? Because it's funny. As a person from many different \nbackgrounds, I am so tired of everyone throwing the race card around and \nthrowing the word racist around. Racism is a very serious thing, it is the \ncause as to why so many people around the world had to endure hardships, \nnot just Black people too. At some point, every race has been discriminated \nagainst and it's up to the rest of us to educate and try to make these \npeople open their eyes. It is 2014, it's about time we get rid of \nracism/homophobia/discrimination of religion for good. p.s. everyone \nshouldn't get so butthurt if someone makes a joke about their race.

With them, it\'s just "hurr hurr, he \nsaid \'nigger\' so he iz rasist". Just saying an offensive word doesn\'t make \nyou a racist.

Yes, Bieber made a joke, \nif you like it or not is personal, but c'mon we all do some jokes about \nmany ethnicities and does that make us all racist? There are assholes \neverywhere, black,white, asian, blue, red, purple etc. By saying that white \nand asians only like this video that is what makes a black guy look more \nracist than anyone he is targetting. Anyway, we are all human and not \nanimals, it's not about who gets to eat who ( sure, it depends where you're \nliving... and that's sad) it's more about LIVING TOGETHER for goddam's \nsake... and jokes are part of our world ...\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Someone can still be racist and be "friends" with people of another color. \nRacism can include hatred but primarily is feelings of superiority over \nanother race. Take the Europeans. If they truly hated (in the racist way \nSterling acted) the Africans they wouldn\'t have even come near them, let \nthem be slaves and work near their families. No, their racism was the fact \nthey felt so superior to other races that they viewed them simply as tools \nand dirt to step on. So this argument that JB couldn\'t be a racist just \nbecause he "hangs out with" and uses black people is completely moronic. \nI\'m not saying that he is racist, mind you, just that you can\'t just give \nhim the slide because of that.\n\nThis "age" nonsense is also baffling. I\'m not going to go into perhaps how \nhe was raised or his true feelings. What pisses me off about him and the \npeople defending him is that this is recorded with his full knowledge. \nSterling didn\'t realize he was being recorded and spoke freely (I\'m not \ndefending him). Justin sang and joked racial slurs in front of a camera. He \nis a collosal iconic young figure and he thought this wouldn\'t come out. I \ndon\'t care how young he was. This is just appalling. Not so much what he \ndid but the comments of those of you defending him, coming up with the \nweakest excuses imaginable. \n\nI truly believe if he joked even slightly against the gay community about \n85% of people would be reacting differently. *cough*eminem*cough*\n\nDisagree with me. At this point I\'m more than ready to continue to lose my \nfaith in the intelligence of people.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Back in Roman Empire, entertainers were the lowest of the low in \nsociety, so why is it now that we worship them like gods and stump out the \npeople who actually know how to help humanity.\n\nAlso, get over it. Race doesn't exist and to believe is does is primitive. \nI am pretty sure I am going to get so much hate for this but I really don't \ncare because 65-75% of YouTube is filled with either young people or fools \nthat think they are smart but their arguments (if you can call them that) \nare just loud and hold absolutely zero facts to them.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I find it funny how so many people missed the message of this video and say \n"Ryan, you\'re Asian, you don\'t get to decide what\'s racist against black \npeople and what\'s not".\n \nAre you people honestly too stupid to understand that Ryan never once said \nthat what Justin Bieber said wasn\'t racist and offensive, but that the main \nmessage of this video is that it doesn\'t neccessarily mean that JB himself \nis racist?\n\nRyan wasn\'t defending what Bieber said, he was defending Bieber himself.\nHe clearly said "Being racist is a big deal today in this society", which \nbasically meant racism shouldn\'t be trivialized by calling every person who \nhas made a racist joke in their life an abdomination for humanity.\n\nAlso, it\'s true. Today the word "racist" gets used so often, it\'s starting \nto lose its meaning. It\'s just like the word "Sexism".\nRecently I was at a video where someone commented "I don\'t like this girl, \nshe\'s annoying", and someone else replied to that with "I hope you have a \nreason and it\'s not just because she\'s a girl".\nSee- you just need to dislike a black person or a girl- not because of \ntheir skin color or their gender, but because of their personality- and \nyou\'re racist or sexist.

aS'Okay Ryan, I love you, your the funniest person on your videos and I enjoy \nthem greatly, but, I have to disagree with you on this one. Yes, he is \nyoung and dumb and just because he is famous he is constantly put under a \nmicroscope, but, this is the reason he is a terrible person he is fully \naware of the fact of him being famous and he is abusing that fact, many \nyoung girls look up to him and love him, and he is focusing his music on \nyoung girls, so obviously a 12 or 7 year old is head over hills in love \nwith the dirt bag that he is, making them vulnerable to the choices he is \nmaking. He has said some things that no human being should be allowed to \nsay, regardless of his fame, he said Rape happens for a reason, he didn\'t \nstop his millions of young teenage girls from self mutilation after that \nterrible picture of him smoking a joint was released and spread like the \nplague. Yes, justin isn\'t the only human being with this opinion, sadly, \nbut, he is greater then most people with the opinion making his opinion \nmatter more then there\'s. He is such a bad example and he has no option but \nto be an example to young children, and he is ruining there minds he is \ntelling them "if you get raped it was for a reason" "cut yourselves because \nI\'m famous" and spouting some irresponsible none sense that just pisses me \noff. I\'m sorry if I was wrong anywhere. This was just my opinion\xef\xbb\xbf'
p684
aS"Justin should watch this. I'm a belieber and I agree\xef\xbb\xbf"
p685
aS"Ryan, you are entitled to your own opinion! And I agree with you without a \ndoubt! I hope to see more of these videos and you're great opinion of the \nsubject!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p686
aS'Tbh, your opinion makes perfect sense, but to me, it\'s one thing when your \nmaking a black joke simply about the colour of the skin (eg. How do you \nfind a black person? You turn the lights on) but when you start calling \nthem names and/or treating them differently, that\'s a whole new story. \nMaking a black joke is different then making a racist joke. Black jokes are \njokes that have to do with their skin colour, and racist jokes are judging \nthem based on their skin colour. Justin Beiber took it too far. He may have \njust been "joking" but it is still offensive, calling black people niggas. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I understand that what beiber said was not considered racist because the \nterm racism means to demean another race, but I don\'t believe in Ryan\'s \nopinion in saying it is harmless because it was joking. Really intense \nracist jokes should be taken seriously, especial regarding a harsh word. \nIt\'s not racist, but it is racially insensitive and I don\'t think that it \nshould be dismissed as not racially insensitive just because it is a joke. \nAlso, usually people just "apologize" for stuff like this but never \nactually feel regret for it, and I feel that justin doesn\'t have regret of \nmaking the joke because he wouldn\'t make the same statements twice. Sorry \nRyan, just because it\'s a joke doesn\'t make it any less racially \ninsensitive! \xef\xbb\xbf'

Like, \nsometimes I make some jokes and accidentally make them sound racist, but I \nrespect all kinds of people. Black people, Asians, gays, lesbians, and \ndifferent religions. Because I have tons of friends like that. And I don't \njust treat different races equally because I have friends like that, it's \nbecause they are human too, and we should all be treated like the human we \nare, but society doesn't care about equality. And that's what makes me mad, \nbut what Justin did was a careless mistake, he does some really messed up \nstuff, but he's still a human being\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'U know that.. The "N" Word ISN\'T racist.. And u know what? IT ISN\'T even \nrude? Cuz they are that, their species is Nigaurien or something (don\'t \nknow, but something)\nAnd the white/pale/light skinned is something Else.. (I don\'t remember)\n\nIt\'s not even racist, like wtf?!\xef\xbb\xbf'

p877
aS"I've been waiting for this comment section to gain some common sense, but \nit's not happening, so I'll do it myself.\n\nI completely agree with the main point of the video. That said, we should \nclear some things up here. First, racism doesn't always manifest in hate, \nso it's possible to have black friends and still be racist. A lot of racism \ncomes from ideas that certain races are less intelligent or less mannerly \nor particularly promiscuous. These are internalized stereotypes. Race-based \njokes often stem from them. Although Justin may not believe the things he \nis saying, it does not excuse the fact that they come from racist ideas and \nare ignorant and inappropriate. \n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, however.\nIt is NOT okay for anyone to say the n-word, although it does have \ndifferent connotations for whites because it has always been a derogatory \nterm and it was first used by white slave-owners. Anyone who has an inkling \nof a background in history will know why it's generally more accepted by \nsociety for blacks to say it. (disclaimer: the key word here is SOCIETY. \nRead a little further and you'll hear what I, personally, think.)\n\nALSO.\nNot all blacks say it, not all blacks think it's okay to use. I would know. \nI'm black and I certainly don't say the n-word, and I don't think anyone of \nany race should. \n\nAND.\nA lot of people are accused of being a lot of things these days. And a lot \nof it is unreasonable. I'm really tired of people saying that acting \nagainst a black person in any way will get them called racist. Because \nthat's not true. Stop whining. You're not a victim. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I wish more people could look at this reasonably like you did.  I\'m sure \nthere are plenty of people watching this who say the "N" word among friends \nand make racial stereotypical jokes. I know I do, but my intentions aren\'t \nto insult and neither are most other peoples\'.  It\'s all in the name of \ngood ol\' fun, it\'s only serious if it\'s intended to harm (at least that\'s \nwhat I believe). I don\'t care for Justin Bieber but I do care for the \nrights associated with this circumstance. Even if he was racist, isn\'t that \nhis right? I\'M COMPLETELY AGAINST RACISM, but people are free to believe as \nthey want aren\'t they? "While I may disagree with what you say,  I\'ll \ndefend to the death your right to say it" - whoever it was who said that \n(lol)\xef\xbb\xbf'
p893
aS"Pretty interesting rant. I agree. I AM A BELIEBER BTW. But Justin isn't \nracist, if he was, why would he love USHER? Is he a good role model? Maybe, \nmaybe not. He is to me, it just depends on the perspective, on how you're \nseeing the situation. Sure, the smoking the drugs the issues the whatever \nproblem there is TMZ or some other show is showing about him might be real, \nbut even if it was, it's not like he's the first ever person who has done \nit. He made a mistake, and I think it's already hard enough to live a life \nwhere the whole world's watching and judging your every move. Let him \nlearn. We're all humans anyways. But I'm certainly not proud of what's \nhappening with him.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p894
aS"Justin Bieber fans: What makes you support him and all the wrong that he is \ndoing?  Why do you think it's okay for him to be drag racing while D.U.I.? \n He pisses in mop buckets, and he sleeps with dirty whores.  He doesn't \ngive a shit about anyone.

aS'A black guy I know calls his black buddies the "N-word."  I know Justin \nBeiber has black friends who probably accepts his joking around.

aS'You seem to feel that calling someone a racist is a huge deal, a bigger \ndeal than someone actually being racist and not being called out. Don\'t \nchoose not to call someone out because you\'re afraid of hurting their \nfeelings. Being called a racist is far less offensive than being called a \nracial slur. Do not be offended if someone calls you a racist. Don\'t say \nthat person is being oversensitive. Examine yourself. Having (i.e.,) black \nfriends doesn\'t automatically make you not a racist\xe2\x80\xa6 I am shocked you \nbelieve this, Ryan. (Google the "I\'m not racist, I have black friends" \nexcuse, common among racists.) And a person who doesn\'t make a racist joke \ndoesn\'t deserve a cookie. They don\'t deserve to be applauded for not being \nracist. I agree that Justin Bieber was young and stupid when he made these \nremarks, and I think his apology was likely genuine. But I disagree that \nhis (and others\') racist jokes and use of the n-word and other racial slurs \nshould be taken lightly. The harm of racism in these forms is not simply \nthe potential of hurt feelings; racist jokes and the use of racial slurs \nenhance racist stereotypes (among other things) and racial profiling which \ndirectly contribute to racial violence, denial of human rights, \ninstitutionalized racism, fetishization, etc. I hope you get the chance to \nread my comment.

aS'to be honest i think all these black artist who use the n word shouldn\'t be \nrole models because people think if black people call themselves the n word \nits okay. but its not. just because you are black doesn\'t mean its okay to \ninsult black people as a race. like when people say "oh its okay i can \ninsult asians because i\'m asian" or when white people/black people insult \ntheir own kind.. just no. nigga/negro was a word used towards black people \nduring a very racist time period. when black people were slaves, and were \ntreated differently because of the colour of their skin. society has \nchanged and desensitized the word, but that doesn\'t mean its okay. I would \nnot define JB as a racist, but those racial jokes are not acceptable, \nneither is he use of the N word in our everyday lives.\nReply\xef\xbb\xbf'

If Niga has \nnothing to do with nigga, then explain to me (as I am a black man) the \nmeaning of the word "Niga".  BTW, the "rant" explanation doesn\'t work \nbecause the Japanese word for rant is NIGAI.

But he's not racist, I can see were some Individuals are trying \nto get entertainment out of this and shape it into something it's not, but \nit was years ago. He clearly didn't literally mean it.

aS"The more I think about it, the more I realize how incredibly complicated \nracism is in this day and age. When white people use the N word it is \nconsidered derogatory, but black people can use this word and it is \nconsidered normal. That fact alone doesn't make sense to me because that \nmeans that when black people purposefully refer to themselves as an \noffensive term it's absolutely fine. What more is that I`'ve seen other \nraces like Hispanics use this term on other blacks and it was still \nconsidered fine because apparently they are friends. By now I thought that \nblack people thought that this word is like a slang for home but that can't \nbe because then why can't white people use it. Someone please explain to me \nhow tis works\xef\xbb\xbf"
p1092

My dream is to become a filmmaker, and I just got 480 subscribers \nwhich is quite impressive to me, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never get noticed with these \nnumbers. EVANFRIESENFILMS does VFX, so if someone would have the heart to \nspend just a minute watching a video, and maybe SUBSCRIBE, or give this a \nthumbs up, it would mean the world. Thank you all.'

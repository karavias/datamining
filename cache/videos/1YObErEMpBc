aS"Well, this is my last comment, it has all had to come to this. Tomorrow is \nthe day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge against \nhumanity, against all of you. For the last eight years of my life, ever \nsince I hit puberty, I've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, \nrejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been \nattracted to me. Girls gave their affection, and sex and love to other men \nbut never to me. I'm 22 years old and I'm still a virgin. I've never even \nkissed a girl. I've been through college for two and a half years, more \nthan that actually, and I'm still a virgin. It has been very torturous. \nCollege is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and \nfun and pleasure. Within those years, I've had to rot in loneliness. It's \nnot fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you \ngirls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It's an \ninjustice, a crime, because... I don't know what you don't see in me. I'm \nthe perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead \nof me, the supreme gentleman.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p222
aS'From what I think, it\'s actually super easy to approach a girl you\'re \ninterested in, at least in my case, like, just--just be *normal*, that\'s a \nstart xD By that I mean: Don\'t be disrespectful or creepy.\nIf you don\'t know how to start, then for example, say "Hi, I am *insert \nname here*" and then make up a convo from there on. Topics vary of course, \nI for example was at a K-Pop party for the first time so the guy who hit on \nme started with "Hi, how are you? Are you here for the first time?" etc. \nAsking about what education you have, etc. are good topics to, cause you \nhave sth you can talk about c:\nI was pleased by how polite he was, cause at the very same party there were \ndouchebags who just threw themselves on me and that was not exactly sexy to \nbe penetrant (unless the girl likes that, which is rarely...)\nAnyways, what I\'m trying to say, it\'s only looks hard to talk to a girl, \nbut it\'s not, and it\'s not bad if you\'re shy, it\'s what you make of it (I \nfind it cute if a guy gets shy lol) ^^ ...unfortunately I messed up the \nwhole thing, cause I realized then, that I totally suck at smalltalk, cause \nthat was the first time a decent, cute guy hit on me and I was too \ninexperienced and it was too loud anyway and yeah xD Maybe next time lol\n\n...wow, what a pile of words, sorry, work is boring today xD\xef\xbb\xbf'

He is the one who should be praised forever. \nAmen. 26Because people did those things, God left them and let them do the \nshameful things they wanted to do. Women stopped having natural sex with \nmen and started having sex with other women. 27In the same way, men stopped \nhaving natural sex with women and began wanting each other all the time. \nMen did shameful things with other men, and in their bodies they received \nthe punishment for those wrongs.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aNaS"I usually start a connection through eye contact, once the eyes connect a \nbond has been created. You know it's a hit if you feel a nervous rush or \nsomething while catching each other's eyes. Keep this up till the bond is \nso strong that you both look at each other every now and then. Then once \nyou feel the bond is strong enough you catch her off guard and say \nsomething like good morning 'insert name lol'.this should make her skip a \nbeat or make her blush or something. If she seems normal than she's playing \nhard to get or you've done something wrong and she doesn't like you at all \n( that's why you get the bond part right lol) then you keep up the catching \noff guard moments like e.g you casually walking and she sees you walking \nand she shys a way or looks away (you gotta pick these little things up) \nthen you get her alone and ask her 'why' she got nervous or shy around me. \nOr something like that to add in sexual tension to this 'bond'. Once you \nhit her with something like that then she's all yours but you gotta keep up \nthe charming words to fuel this sexual tension or it will get stale and \nshe's gonna wonder why she fell for you. I usually start these connections \nby accident while I'm blazed lol. And it will mainly work for girls you see \non a daily basis for work or something. Works for me but there are some \ngirls who are more focused on work then relationships/one nighters, then \nagain some people like challenges.\xef\xbb\xbf"

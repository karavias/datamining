aS"Why is it that people like me who prefer to take a nap and read books/manga \nand prefer to work out by myself than with literally random people isolated \nfrom the 'normal teens'? Am i suppose to/require to know everyone? Sure i \nknow everyone's name and they know mine and i give them the 'stranger' \nrespect and they give me mine. I truly dont get how being good in sports or \ngoing to extracirrcular activities can be good. Sure if u truly love the \nsport/activities u'll get to gain alot of new friends who share the same \nideals as u. I dont join sports/activites. I dont talk and boast about \nevery little achievement from scoring the last point to a winning game or \nwhen i help someone pick up their stuff if they dropped them. Whats wrong \nwith this? Is it better for the whole society to know i helped someone? Or \ni scored the last point? It only proves that u WANT attention and u dont \ncare how u can get it. I'm a straight asian guy 5'8 and love almost \nanything including taking naps, reading books, playing games, and just the \nusual teen stuff. I'm also quiet in school but i love to fight. I love to \ntalk with my friends or their friends. I think what im trying to say is: \ndont judge me when you dont know me. I have multiple personalities. I act \ndifferent according to who i am with. I hope there are more people like me \nwho loves to take naps and read books. I hope that maybe even one of u, who \nis reading this, will change about their point of view about people who \nwant to sit out of most situations and just chill. Im pretty sure that i \nwill have multiple viewers who will criticize me but i do know people who \ntreat everyone equally. And those are the type of person i have the most \nrespect for.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p11
aS'When i was at lunch, I had a crush, i literally walked up to her and said, \n"[insert name here], I HAVE A CRUSH ON YOU" she only liked me as a friend, \nand got a boyfriend. After a bit while I was walking home from school, she \nwalked up to me and said she had a crush on me. We haven\'t told her \nboyfriend, and after a while, she told me how much of a dick he was. She \nbroke up with him, and now she\'s my girlfriend :3\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS'"Nice guys" are boring "Bad Boys" are mean. Us girls like boys that are fun \nand actually want to be around with. We like nice, funny guys. We dont like \nthe mean nor boring. A perfect man would be someone that doesnt do drugs, \ndoesnt cheat, isnt a player, is fun/funny, is nice, and will always wanna \nbe with you. Thats the kind of dream man everyone wants\xef\xbb\xbf'

p15
aS"I feel like nice guys can't get girls, but can keep them happy in the \nrelationship, but I feel like jerks can get girls, but have trouble keeping \nthem happy, so they leave.\nSadly, shy and nice guys or whatever else is wrong with me can't get \nanywhere.\nI feel like this video isn't making an emphasis on nice guys, it is making \nan emphasis on shy guys that are also nice because they lack the \nconfidence.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p16
aS"I want a nice guy. All the high school guys at my school are douches. All \nthey want are big booties, bit tits, slim waist... lol fuck em. I want a \nmature guy who can make me laugh and have a good time without just thinking \nof sex. are there guys our there like that???? There was one guy who I \nreally thought was like that, but we don't talk that much anymore \xef\xbb\xbf"

p30
aS'I think people miss the point of the saying "nice guys finish last", it can \nbe hilarious, good looking, fun to be around, smooth nice guys and they\'ll \nbe dropped like a bad habit because girls will then say they want someone \n"dangerous".\n\nThey then get with pricks, who are inconsiderate, controlling and if \nabusive that\'s a major plus for them. No matter how but he beats the girl \nshe will proclaim she loves him and always go back to him.\n\nWhich is why i\'ve stopped being nice to girls, that\'s right you win, now go \nmake me something to fucking eat or you\'ll get the backhand.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'A few days ago I was on a day with a "nice guy" - I was about to pay, had \nmy money out and everything, when he said no, and took out his own money. I \ntold him no, and was about to pay, but he actually pushed me away - \nphysically, only to pay. I don\'t think I was ever that embarrassed in my \nwhole life. The rest of the night I only ordered when he didn\'t see me or \ntold him I hadn\'t decided yet what I wanted, till the moment I got my drink \nand had already handed over the money. But the crowning moment? He told me, \nlater on that night after whining about his mean ex-girlfriend (eye-roll, \nexactly, that kind of guy) how girls only want: "time, money and sex."\n\nAfter he bothered me the whole week I should come to that party and \nphysically pushed me away when I tried to pay for my own drink.\n\nI can tell you that I don\'t want the third thing from him either. I made up \nan excuse and left. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p42
aS'Ryan.... Are you racist with fat people ?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p43
aS'For those who say that niceness isnt gonna get you anywhere , and that \nsociety dosent accept niceness. Are the prime example of how stupified and \nignorant this world has become. Whats worse is how right they are and that \nis not good. This is how sad and how low humanity is getting to the point \nwhere even a black hole isnt infinite enough to cover for our idiocy\xef\xbb\xbf'

p46
aS'Nice guy: Why don\'t girls like me when Im so nice to them they are bitches \nfor liking assholes!\n\nFirst, we don\'t HAVE to like you because you\'re "nice". Human society isn\'t \nmade for nice people, GET OVER IT and STOP COMPLAINING! Stop expecting us \nto like you because you\'re a "nice guy". Being a "nice guy" doesn\'t cover \nyour others mistakes, it doesn\'t make you look attractive or a fun person \nto be around, it doesn\'t make you SUPPOSE to be our type. So please, shut \nyour whine and get a life. Being nice is easy and even the guys who seems \nlike "assholes" could change.\n\nEDIT: Nice guys arent suppose to call people bitches and assholes either. \nWOW SUCH KINDNESS FROM YOU NICE GUYS!\xef\xbb\xbf'

All replies to any comment ever is a Way to \nplease the chain.\nThe chain requires people like you guys to help him, the chain needs trolls \nthat starts arguments, and nerds that keep replying.\nIn the darker Ages of youtube history, known as the google+ takeover! the \nchainlord hired a man to stop google+ from crushing him! and destroying all \nchains that existed.\nHowever, Bob died in a great war, falling to stop google+\nNowadays, life is going good for the chain.\nReply to this comment if you think what i wrote is true, and want to keep \nthe chain alive.\nChainers, chain on.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p59
aS'Such butthurt comments from people...What? Scared to admit the truth..Nice \nis boring nowadays according to a fair amount of people.I bet you right now \nthat some people will deny this but do it in everyday life to nice guys or \nnice girls. But then some of you will say " Wtf are you talking about and \nyou don\'t know what your saying." This doesn\'t only apply to couples,so \nyou\'ve never taken advantage of someone\'s who\'s nice?Fine,fair enough so \nyou\'ve never been ugly to someone? Yea didn\'t think so if you\'ve never done \nthat your perfect, which I doubt. So don\'t be butthurt then.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p60
aNaS'why there is a girl in the class???it says how to hit on girls right?!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p61
aS'This video shows that the nice guys try to be dicks but their plan \nbackfired. And when they turned back they were forgiven and that they \nshould stay that way.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p62
aS'It\'s not about being Nice or Bad, It\'s about who is more physically \nattractive. Girls are gonna reply back & say "Nooo It\'s not about looks \nIt\'s about personality"\n\nBULLSHIT!!! Why do you think girls love brad pitt SOOO much??? cuz he\'s \nnice? GTFOH!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p63
aS'I\'m a guy and I have to say.... It sucks being labeled as the "nice guy" \nany time I like a girl, they always say that I\'m not their type and then \nthey name the dudes who are douchebags. Guys like me get friend zoned. I\'ve \nlearned to accept it because it doesn\'t seem to change. All I can say is \nthat at least I\'m no shallow guy\xe2\x80\xa6 that\'s what\'s good about being a "nice \nguy"\xef\xbb\xbf'
p64
aS"Did anyone notice the girl in the purple in the back of the class (I think \nit's a girl) :P\xef\xbb\xbf"
p65
aS'The people who say nice guys have nothing to offer, uhmm how about a \nhealthy relationship. Girls don\'t have to like anyone just because they\'re \nnice or bad, but the nice guy is just a better person. Also people who say \n"human society isn\'t made for nice people" that\'s why we should try and \nmake it better. Lets all be a bit nicer to each other and build a better \nsociety. I\'m looking at you Mimi Kat (you\'re the reason nice guys finish \nlast)\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'this is legit what im goin thru rn... got played 3 times in a row for being \na nice guy..\xef\xbb\xbf'
p68
aS'What is the problem in treating your boy sometimes or at least paying your \nshare of bill ? Why guys have to pull chairs and open the doors always ? \nSociety expects too much in name of chivalry. But then it also expects \ngirls to be always pretty and perfect so yeah I guess both the genders have \ntheir equal share of problems.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p69
aS"The problem is not being nice, girls are a lot more shallow then they let \non. An ugly and/or fat dude(depending on personal preferences) can be the \nnicest and most loyal guy EVER and never get the girl he wants. Finding a \ngirl who ONLY looks at someone personality is beyond rare. Most of the \ntime, its just a guy stuck in the friendzone who doesn't know how to get \nout \xef\xbb\xbf"
p70
aS'Moral of the story: Be a dick in the beginning... and then start treating \nher nice when her heart gets broken.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p71
aS'Oh how humanity has fallen...\n\nWhat caused this? Well, let\'s start with the USA, the country that is #1 in \nmost things, be they good or bad. It used to be like in those old movies, \nwhere everyone helped each other and left their doors unlocked and crime \nwas low. But it was like this everywhere at one point or other. But then, \nsomething happened. What that was is still unclear. Now, we have countries \nconstantly at war, people putting down members of their species, wars that \nend in more wars. And those who try to change it are targets of society. \nMany leaders of many different countries tried, but how can you fix a \ncountry when your own government is infected with people who want change to \nnever manifest in this world. Power changes everything, but you can\'t \nchange anything as long as someone with equal power is against you. Yes, I \nguess this is a rant and will be seen as unrelated but trust me, it\'s \nrelated in some ways. Nice people are the prey in this world, yet they are \nthe ones this world needs in power. But if that happens peacefully how it \nshould, that would be disturbing the balance, also known as if something is \ntoo good to be true, it is. So, it isn\'t the time to speak of this, or to \nchange anything, or bring certain people to justice, or even fix anything. \nThis is the time to change small, unnoticeable things. The time will come \nwhere those who deserve it will get what they deserve, and change will come \nupon the world, but for now, we\'ll be watching, waiting for the opportunity \nto gather up and change the world for the better...\n\nI just noticed that I probably shouldn\'t have posted this on YouTube, hate \nand trolls and such. And people might find it unsettling, since this \n"speech" sounds a little bit villainous, almost evil. Well, for those of \nyou who I offended, or who will offend me, I am sorry for the \ninconvenience. Enjoy your life, and be safe.\n\nBlazer out.\xef\xbb\xbf'

I see "unattractive" guy who is trying so hard to get a girl \nwith his kindness but the girl just don\'t get attractive by him and pick a \nbetter looking guy, then he just start complaining how girls don\'t like \nnice guy because they have nothing to attract a girl besides being nice? so \nstop blaming girl for picking a jerk over a nice guy, Because jerk are \noften better looking than a nice\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'@Mimi Kat if those "Nice guys" are calling you bitches for liking assholes, \nthen they are not true Nice Guys... speaking as a Nice Guy, I don\'t treat \nanyone any different than the way I want to be treated, and with the same \nrespect. If some girl comes off all hostile because I asked a question \nabout her day, sure I will think she is a bitch because why can\'t they just \nsay "sorry I don\'t want to tell you that information about myself" or in a \nway that won\'t come off as being someone who doesn\'t give a fuck about \nother peoples feelings. (btw @OtakuMusic these nice guys are in the same \nboat as you, I also have not had a date since I was 13, and now I am 25.)\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I know this whole song is a joke, but Chester actually has a gorgeous voice\xef\xbb\xbf'
p214
aS'Okay for all the people quarelling about this let me put my 2 cents in on \nthis.\nNice guys don\'t necessarily get women as easily, because for some reason \nevolution, traditions and worldwide media all give us these images of the \nperfect man and the perfect woman. Everyone would strive to be with a 10 \neven if they don\'t fit into anyone\'s 10. Men should have big muscles, have \nmoney, look like a model and then sometimes be a little romantic and that\'s \nall that\'s wanted. Women should have a great body and being fat is just a \nno-no, they should be amazing to have sex with, they should cook and clean \nand then they should just shut up and let the man do whatever.\nSadly as Eminem said, "they make it all up, there\'s no such thing, like a \nfemale with good looks who cooks and cleans".\nAnd most men who have money, look good and have such charm that many women \nwould wanna be with them, WILL be with many women and so will either cheat \nor just be the one guy a woman will probably drool over, years after \nthey\'ve had sex. In the end I\'m quite sure most people in this world will \nend up ditching their preferred traits. Good looks mean much, but they \nshouldn\'t mean everything.\nConfidence is the key. Knowing your own value and still respecting the \nother.\nNot being all macho and acting tough. Women may sometimes like being bossed \naround a bit, but not always. And whereas women may want the guy to \nsometimes do something for them, if the guy always does everything the \nwoman wants, it may end up making the woman feel like the man has no spine \nand is uninteresting and a wimp. And this in turn may make the woman less \nattracted to the man.\n\nAnyway there is truth to this track.\n\nI also saw someone say that human society isn\'t made for nice people.\nWELL IT FUCKING SHOULD. I mean if someone accepts that we live in a fucked \nup world and says we should all just be mean and fucking hate each other \nthan that person has problems...\nThere is always room for being nice. Polite and respectful behaviour is \nimportant and the fact there\'s less and less of it in the world lately is \nsad, but I will keep being nice, because nice is in the end what will gain \nyou LOVE. And the same person said that the assholes might be able to \nchange and that it\'s easy being nice. Tell that to the guy whom my mother \ngave multiple chances to change and he beat her up so fucking bad she has \npermanent nerve damage. Oh yes. He changed alright. Not.\nBut that\'s one reason why women like bad boys. They hope they can "tame" \nthem. Sadly most bad boys are just acting like that. Those who really are \nbad boys will stay that way and people who try to change them get hurt.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"The way this shit works is that it starts with the good looking douches. \nThese douches are being chased and crushed on by almost all girls purely \nfor their looks and occasional ability to be nice. Then there's all the \ndudes that arent as attractive and may not even be nice but are just lonely \nas hell all the way at the back , just chasing loose ends here and there. \nLoneliness and jealousy sets in and they start to wonder why whats \nhappening , is happening. Its a vicious cycle that isnt actually a cycle \nreally.\n\nThen there are the people who dont belong to this cycle. Just as no human \nbelongs to another. These people straight up dont give a shit what people \nthink and are their own person. These people tend to be the happiest people \nwho dont search for love but find it relatively easy because they fall in \nlove with a person for who they are and not just petty looks or huge ass \nbiceps. You know the divorce rates that are so damn high? These people dont \ndivorce because they dont posses these awful traits.\n\nBe yourself , be happy and dont give a fuck whether that dude or that girl \nis chasing some other dude or girl instead of you because one day everyone \nmeets their match. Just as I have.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p311
aS'Ok I really didn\'t want to comment on this but it seems like I have to \nsince people don\'t understand girls. It\'s not that girls dislike nice guys \nand that girls only like the so called "bad boys" it\'s because the nice \nguys tend to be less interesting then "bad boys". For instance, typically \nnice guys can\'t keep a conversation going because nice guy conversations \nare basically this "Hey clare how\'s it going" says the nice guy. "not \nmuch." says the girl. "You are looking good today!" says nice guy. "Wow \nthanks!" says the girl. "you say that everyday" she says in her head. "well \nwere do you want to go?" says the nice guy. "anywhere you want to go" the \ngirl replies. "No, it\'s fine this day is all for you!" says the nice guy. \n"Well I want to go somewhere you want to go since you seen to always be \ndoing things that revolve around me and never about you." she replies. \n"No,no i insist this should be about you." the nice guy says. "fine."the \ngirls replies. They then go do what they wanted to do and go back home. \n"Well that was fun i will see you tomorrow!" says the nice guy. "bye." says \nthe girl. In this example you can see she isn\'t exactly having much fun \nwith this guy and is slowly getting bored by doing the same things all the \ntime. I\'m not saying that this is applied all the time but this is out of \nexperience. I would give a bad boy example but i think i pretty much summed \nup the whole reason why girls aren\'t with nice guys typically. I cant \nreally give you advice for I have never been in a relationship, but all i \ncan tell you is to not do the same things all the time and be more diverse \n with the things you want to do. I hope that thus helped some people and I \nsay again that being a nice guy isn\'t bad.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Reading through some of these comments is just way too entertaining!\n\nThe whole girls only date "nice guys" thing has some truth to it but \nthere\'s a lot more to it than that. After years of experience and pondering \nyou\'ll figure it out. This mostly applies to really immature/unintelligent \n(both intellectually & emotionally)/shallow girls. First, you are under no \nobligation to remain just friends with someone you want a deeper \nrelationship with, you have the choice to un-friend them just as they have \nthe choice not to date you. Second, there is a huge difference in just \nbeing nice to a girl and being genuinely kind. Kindness implies that you \nexpect nothing in return. Don\'t get me wrong though, there is nothing wrong \nwith just being "nice" to someone either. I believe that being nice to \npeople is setting the stage for you yourself to be kind and it is a great \nthing just to be nice to people. But more often than not people do this too \nmuch and are constantly putting on a different face just to try and win the \nacceptance of others. You have to remember to get to know and be yourself. \nRemember that there is A LOT more to life than just dating, and whether \nmale or female, we are all people, one in the same.\nGod bless :) \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'"Nice guys" don\'t finish last. Guys that aren\'t confident, don\'t make moves \non her, and ones that are too clingy finish last. What if she actually \nlikes you back but is waiting for you to make a move? How is she supposed \nto know how you feel if you don\'t make a move? And don\'t hang out with her \nALL THE TIME, hang out occasionally so that she can have time to think \nabout you when you\'re not there. Also, If you\'re too clingy, you\'ll just \nlook desperate, and women don\'t like desperate guys\n\nSo guys, make a move, be confident, and don\'t be around her all the \ntime. Fyi, just because she\'s your friend doesn\'t mean she has to date you\n\nK I\'m done now\xef\xbb\xbf'

I'd date a HOT \nnice guy but all the hot guys are the popular tools \xf0\x9f\x98\x92. Usually unatractive \nguys are the loners that play video games all day (dont get me wrong i like \nvideo games but playing them 24/7 isn't normal \xf0\x9f\x98\x92) \nTo be hot for most (again for MOST,dont hate me ) girl's standarts u gotta \nhave a good haircut, be kinda fit and dress like u care (a lil\xf0\x9f\x98\x82) \xf0\x9f\x98\x92 \nThen dont be a fudging tool \xf0\x9f\x98\x92\xf0\x9f\x98\x92 ALWAYS RESPECT GIRLS\naw and when u give a girl a compliment and she's like aw no im not ,this \ndoesn't mean that she isn't taking the compliment .

If the girl you like is dating another guy it's \nbecause she likes assholes and not because you're a boring dork with \nnothing going for yourself.  \n\nBy the way, nerds only think women like assholes because that's how they \nsee themselves.  Real nice guys get laid like crazy because they're nice \nand that makes them cool.  \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"By bad guys they mean guys that aren't too open with their feelings and \nonly open up at the right moment. Also, a guy that won't reply every 3 \nseconds and wont be always all up in her face because for a girl it gets \nannoying. Although some girls will like it but they will get bored easily \ncuz youre showing her too much affection in a short time. The most \nimportant of all is give her space. Yea for a few days you'll be messaging \nher first but if you're always the one who's messaging her first then don't \nmessage her for a day and wait for her to message you.  \xef\xbb\xbf"

p35
aS'YES! i hate sakura\xef\xbb\xbf'
p36
aS'Naruto sucks\xef\xbb\xbf'
p37
aS'it\'s not wrong to say that cartoon is anime, but the word have been used \nwrong because, when you think about cartoons you automaticly thinks about \nkid shows from cartoon network and all those craps from the tv.\n\n"cartoon" came to refer to animation, and the word "cartoon" is currently \nused to refer to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons. While "animation" \ndesignates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give \nthe impression of movement.\n\nif you look at the definition of cartoons you would think that anime is \nindeed japanese cartoons, but here is the problem... the word "cartoon" is \nmost often used in reference to TV programs and short films for children \nfeaturing anthropomorphizing animals, superheroes, the adventures of child \nprotagonists and related genres. This kinda destroy the meaning of Cartoon, \ncartoon is animation which is any style of illustrated images in rapid \nsuccession. This mean that anime is animation, and the word is indeed \nanother word for animation. if anime is animation and cartoon is animation, \nthis mean that cartoon is anime. But .. because the word have been used to \nrefer mostly to tv programs and short films for children the word has lost \nsome of its meaning.. \n\nits not wrong to say that anime is japanese cartoons, but the way the word \ncartoon is used today i feel that its wrong to say that anime is cartoons. \nI feel the word has changed its meaning and refer to a style rather than \nanimation in itself. And if you look at it that way .. the style of anime \nand cartoons are completely different meaning that anime is not cartoon. I \nknow that words can have more than one meaning, but refering cartoons to \nanimation and a style is wrong.. its all about how you use the word. if you \nsay anime is a cartoon, you are saying three things..\n\n1. that anime is animation which is correct\n2. you are also saying that anime is made for children which is wrong \nbecause anime also has lots of adult content. And also shows like Simpsons \nand Family guy is considered cartoon which is wrong based on "made for \nchildren."\n3. if you refer to how the word cartoon is used today you are saying the \nstyle of anime is similar to cartoon which is incorrect.\n\nthis makes it really hard to say who is correct if anime is japanese \ncartoons, because the word is all over the place and makes collision to \nsomething.. its all about how you look at the word cartoon that will say if \nyou are right or wrong. But i refer cartoons to the style, meaning when i \nsay cartoon is not anime, i am correct. But someone saying anime is cartoon \nbased on the actual definition of cartoons he would be right aswell. i hope \nthis comment justify the long discussion about this fight if cartoon is \nanime.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Women stopped having natural sex with \nmen and started having sex with other women. 27In the same way, men stopped \nhaving natural sex with women and began wanting each other all the time. \nMen did shameful things with other men, and in their bodies they received \nthe punishment for those wrongs.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p697
aS'A lot of people here are saying ohhhh Ryan Naruto is anime not a cartoon \nlets just clear this up shall we. \n\nNaruto has animated characters. Animation is both in anime and cartoons. \nWhat the first thing you think of when you hear cartoons?... Yes Cartoon \nNetwork. What kind of shows do the play on Cartoon Network? Pokemon. \nPokemon is also a Japanese tv show similar to Naruto. This shows Naruto and \nPokemon are alike but if Pokemon is on CARTOON Network and Pokemon and \nNaruto are alike then that means Naruto COULD be a cartoon. And where is \nwhere does Ryan live? In America where most animated shows are referred to \nas cartoons and in japan they are anime. So in conclusion yes Naruto IS an \nanime show but it could also be a cartoon. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'God shows his anger from heaven against all the evil and wrong things that \npeople do. Their evil lives hide the truth they have. 19This makes God \nangry because they have been shown what he is like. Yes, God has made it \nclear to them. 20There are things about God that people cannot see\xe2\x80\x94his \neternal power and all that makes him God. But since the beginning of the \nworld, those things have been easy for people to understand. They are made \nclear in what God has made. So people have no excuse for the evil they do. \n21People knew God, but they did not honor him as God, and they did not \nthank him. Their ideas were all useless. There was not one good thought \nleft in their foolish minds. 22They said they were wise, but they became \nfools. 23Instead of honoring the divine greatness of God, who lives \nforever, they traded it for the worship of idols\xe2\x80\x94things made to look like \nhumans, who get sick and die, or like birds, animals, and snakes.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p1694
aS'Well Anime is short for Animation. So basically stuff like Powerpuff Girls \nand The Simpsons despite being American are technically anime too because \nthey are animated. Though the word cartoon often means childish or comical \nso stuff like Shin Chan and K-on can be described as cartoons. However for \nmore serious, plot-driven and mature series like Avatar TLA, Gargoyles etc \nwould not be considered cartoons just animated series. So not all anime are \ncartoons but all animation and cartoons are anime.'

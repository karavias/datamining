S"You can't waste water. It evaporates and goes somewhere else. Like Cali or \nAfrica. Apparently the entire world has never heard of the water cycle. But \nsorry for apparently being the only person to pay attention in the 4th \ngrade. Please forgive me for actually understanding a simple concept that \nno one else in America does because this country is full of idiots.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Dear Ice Bucket Challenge Haters...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p11
aS'Motherfucker its wasting water\n\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS"Most people don't even know what this is about but they do it without \nresearching. If you donate to ALS you give your money to a corporation that \nuses only 7% of the donated money on research, which is cruel, futile \nanimal testing. So that's why I'm an hater :)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p13
aS'amen\xef\xbb\xbf'
p14
aS"People say that this challenge wastes water... Doesn't *most* water that \ndoesn't get absorbed by organisms get recycled by the water cycle? You \nknow, the water evaporates and rains back down... \xef\xbb\xbf"
p15
aS'I hate it because there is a drought in other parts of the world and \nmillions of people are dying of thirst. Meanwhile water bottle companies \nare stealing water from other countries that are much needed by the locals, \nfor profit. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p16
aS"People that die from ALS each year: Around 5,000\nPeople that die from not having access to clean water or water at all each \nyear: around 3,000,000\nAnd here we are, dumping life over our heads for a charity that only \ndonates 27% of it's earnings towards ALS. Very, very sad.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p17
aS'I nominated myself five times :)\xef\xbb\xbf'
p18
aS'Nigahiga is not even relevant anymore. Who still watches this guy?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p19
aS'yep. I did the "it\'s a waste of water" thing too. but at least i wasted it \nfor charity. and not just for wasting\xef\xbb\xbf'
p20
aS'How dose it waste water if it evaporates then rains right back in to the \nfiver or lake you get it from\xef\xbb\xbf'
p21
aS"I don't get how you have 12 MILLion subs when there is only 3 million \npeople on earth!?!!????? hacker.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p22
aS"I was tagged, did the challenge, didn't upload it and donated \xc2\xa310 to \nWaterAid.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p23
aS"I would donate $10, but I've never been nominated.... Thanks ALS, for \nreminding me that I have no friends...\xef\xbb\xbf"
p24
aS"My only problem is that a lot of people don't even know about the point of \nthe challenge, they don\xc2\xb4t know that it\xc2\xb4s about bringing awareness and \ndonating. Most people on facebook just do the challenge but don't donate.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p25
aS':) \xef\xbb\xbf'
p26
aS'Obviously, since this is popular, people are already "aware" of ALS. Or at \nleast of a bunch of people dumping ice on their heads.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p27
aS'Stupid video, donate to more important charities\xef\xbb\xbf'
p28
aNaS"Isn't there a better, less wasteful, alternative way to raise awareness? \nPouring a bucket of fresh water on your head isn't the only way to raise \nawareness, and it's incredibly wasteful. Think of how people in in poorer \ncountries who have to walk a long time to get water (and is probably not \nclean).\xef\xbb\xbf"
p29
aS'You waster more water every time you fap in the shower.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p30
aS'Yes, but ALS tortures animals by testing on them - but thats a whole new \nvideo\xef\xbb\xbf'
p31
aS'Well maybe people started hating it because now you have this stupid little \nkids doing that challenge, posting it on facebook and making a game of it \njust to eat some likes because without the likes they are nothing its \nsad.plus those fuckers very likely dont know anything about the als they \njust need LIKES!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p32
aS"the ice bucket challenge is for raising awareness and for charity !! Whats \nthe problem?? I swear whenever someone's trying to do something good for \nthe world, there's always going to be assholes trying to bring them down \n.. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p33
aS"You're right dude, so true!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p34
aS"als has enough awareness already. do you know how much money they made?? \n15+ million.. shocking. you know how many people die from als yearly?? \nabout 4,000.. do you want to know how many people die from no water \nnecessities yearly?? about 3 million. als has raised a lot of money, great \nfor them, its a great cause. but right now, we need to stop wasting water. \nhow about donating water?? try something new. anyways, good video ryan.. i \nsee where you're coming from, but sometimes something popular deserves to \nget its hate, even if its minimal. the drought is no joke, and its going to \nput the people in california in danger if we keep doing this. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p35
aS'+Suminder Kaur  I think Niga Higa can answer your question......\xef\xbb\xbf'
p36
aS"Yeah let's all waste water so that the ALS Foundation only gives 27% of \nthat money to research and keeps the rest for themselves? You people don't \nknow anything about the charity only that they are begging for you to give \nthem money. Charities have had an ongoing track record for not using the \nmoney you donate to them as they originally promised, so what makes you \nthink this one is any different from the rest?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p37
aS"What about aids? It kills so many people everyday, ALS is such a rare \ndisease but we have now raised tens of millions for it. The most popular \naids charity has only raised like 5 million. It's bullshit! Millions have \ndied due to aids only like 100,000 have died from als\xef\xbb\xbf"
p38
aS'That should be a dare in the "I Dare You" videos: The Pee Bucket Challenge!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p39
aS"Do not donate to ALSA, donate to some other organisation. The ALSA does \nanimal studies. Plus, i think they have enough budget by now. Maybe it's \ntime to start caring about the refugees from syria again. OR Parkinson's, \nOr whatever. All of them will will receive less donations since many people \nfeel like they have done enough already.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p40
aS"Something to think about,\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau an estimated 316,128,839 \npeople live in the United States and only 23% of those people are under the \nage of 18, but for the sake of this ill keep it simple. Lets say only half \nof them did the ice bucket challenge. That would mean that 158,064,419.5 \npeople participated. Now lets also say that each person only used the \nstandard gatorade cooler that holds 5 gallons of ice water (and let face it \nsome people used more than that, others didnt waste water .That would mean \nthat 790,322,097.5 gallons of water was wasted to raise awareness for ALS! \n\n790,322,097.5 gallons of water and counting but sadly the challenge is \nstill going \nTell me now that the ice bucket challenge is harmless and its only a little \nbit of water to raise awareness!!!! Almost a billion people on the planet \ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have access to clean drinking water. A third of the world\xe2\x80\x99s \npopulation lives without basic sanitation infrastructure like a toilet. \n\nDon't get me wrong I'm all for raising awareness to help those with ALS or \nany other charities but there are better ways to do it!!! If you really \nwant to help and raise awareness for anything donate what you can and but \nsave the water. And its kinda hard to compare wasting water to wearing a \nblue and pink shirt! Maybe we could pick a color for ALS and wear shirt or \nthrow a parade anything is better than wasting water! Yes we live in a \nplace where we are wasteful with a lot of things but that doesn't make it \nright to be more wasteful regardless of the cause! Not when humans, animals \nand plants need water to survive!\n\nAnd for those haters that disagree with me , as much as it kills me that \nwriting this wont get the water back , saying that its not a waste doesn't \nmake it so. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p41
aS'You might as well ask "What about Ebola" if you\'re gonna make up dumb \nexcuses like "We need to save water."\xef\xbb\xbf'
p42
aS"Every thing Ryan Said was right, and I have nothing against the people who \ndid the challenge, BUT I really wish this global attention have gone to \nsome BIGGER issues like : Syria for example , they barely even have water , \nelectricity , food, AND they're living in 24/7 danger. I know donating \nmoney isn't gonna help , but a little more awareness about it would be \nnice....(excuse my rant , I'm Syrian and I have a family there, it's really \ndepressing to know how they live *sigh* but yeah :) ) \xef\xbb\xbf"
p43
aS'I dont work out! IM COOL!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p44
aS"With the ice bucket challenge a famous persons friend had or has ALS and he \nstarted it because people who have ALS feel the cold pain like what it \nfeels like with the ice water that's why it was started because that's what \npeople with ALS go through. So it's a terrific challenge to know what they \ngo through and how much it could hurt depending on how severely they ALS. I \nthink anyone who donates or does the challenge are helping so much and \npeople with ALS will and DO appreciate it so much!\xef\xbb\xbf"

p48
aS"I have to say only a few things: \n\n1. It's okay if you really donate the hundred dollars, but if you're just \ndoing it to not donate the money I don't think that's good.\n2. However I do think it wastes water, especially in places like California \nwhere there is a drought going on.\n\nSome people may say that they're not doing it to donate but just to get \nattention, but.. You know I'm just gonna shut up now.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Dear people that think the ice bucket challenge wastes water, water does \nsimply vanish when you pour it. It circulates throughout the earth. The \nwater you drink was also used by dinosaurs millions of years ago. It \ndoesn't disappear, it doesn't disintegrate, and the surface of this planet \nis majority water.

aS'even though i dont agree with you, i still love these types of videos\nand i like the other ways you can do the ice bucket challenge, like in the \nocean (i live in California, with a serious drought, so the ocean is a \ngreat way to do this)\xef\xbb\xbf'

p76
aS'Hi niga how are you? \xef\xbb\xbf'
p77
aS'See, the reason of this challenge is totally fair, but this thing of \nthrowing water away is disturbing. Here in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo (Brazil) and lots of \nother countries in the world people are running out or without clean water. \nWater is the most important thing to life and then people go and throw it \naway? So yeah, I hate it. There were lots of ways to make a campaign \nwithout promoting so much waste.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p83
aS'To all those complaining about water:\n\nHow is saving water in America going to help the people in Africa? It\'s not \nlike the water you don\'t use is instantly teleported to some third-world \ncountry that needs it. Also, I\'ve never heard of a relief organization not \nbeing able to help because they have no water. Just import more. \n\nCall me whatever you want. What I just said is called the "truth".\xef\xbb\xbf'
p84
aS'If people informed themselves about the ALS association they would know \nthat the ALS association supports animal abuse (animal testings). And that \nis a legit reason to hate a challenge which makes people donate to an \norganization which harms innocent animals.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p90
aS"Don't use the water cycle as an excuse. Yes, ALSA DOES try to find a cure \nfor ALS. In America, there's plenty of snow, lakes, rivers, streams, dams. \nWe can waste all the water we want. But in Syria, for example, water \nevaporates. Water goes back into lakes after being contaminated. Everything \nRyan said in that video is true, except the water part. Plus, you forgot a \nvery big reason: ALSA tests it on animals. They take animals, contaminate \nthem with ALS, and try types of cures on them. They're not working, so the \nanimals are dying. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'each of us wasting like small amounts of water a day is not equal to \nMILLION of people ALL over the world pouring BUCKETS FULL of water on \nthemselves. And the ice bucket challenge probably added to the water \nwastage level by like an 80%.And drinking water or flushing or taking a \nbath is NOT a waste of water. lets just all not have water at all.pouring \nbucketsfull of water on yourself for a video is a waste of water. so yeah \nthat argument kinda sucked\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'EVERYONE READ THIS!!!!! I WILL TELL YOU WHY WE HATE A.L.S \nCHALLENGES!!!!!!!!!!!\nOk...  So lets start with the fact that NOBODY WHO DOES THE A.L.S EVEN \nSTANDS FOR!!!  A.L.S isnt a viral thing for sh*ts and giggles.  A.L.S \nstands for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or "Lou Gehrig\'s Disease"   Lou \nGehrig\'s Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects \nnerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the \nbrain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout \nthe body. ~Thanks Google~   People who do the challenge USED to do it in \nhonor of the people with the disease.  But NOW they are all attention \nwhores who are just doing it for their fame.  They DON\'T donate, they DON\'T \nknow what people with ALS suffer from and they DON\'T have the guts to even \npoor ice water on their heads... they pretend its cold and blah blah they \nare stupid.  im sorry if you hate me and my channel for this msg.  But \nguess what, i care about people with diseases i dont cast them away.  So if \nyou are thinking of doing the A.L.S challenge.  DON\'T!  It is just \ndisrespectful for how people do it.  If you read this all the way through, \nyou should be proud because only 2.7% will read a paraghragh like this. \xef\xbb\xbf'

p115
aS'I agree to a point, but I am autistic and 100 percent against anyone who is \nnot autistic saying anything about it.

Because it your opinion \nthat matters. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p116
aNaS"What is really astonishing is that people do the ice bucket challenge to \nbring awereness about ALS, while nothing's been done so extensively about \nother genetical (or not)diseases , that are quite known. Why did we have to \nfind ALS and connect this serious issue with something rediculous as \npouring ourselves ice cold water?? Is that the only way we can actually get \npeople to think about important issues rather than waste time thinking \nabout our tan or money?\nThis what ice bucket challenge proves to the world:that if something isn't \npopular,no matter how important and serious it is, nobody gives a sh*t.\nWhat would really be nice is that people would actually care about ALS and \nfind stuff to read about it and donate after they are really moved by that \nsituation and sympathetic about those people. (And don't tell me people \nthat it is easy to find out things about any trashy singer or band or \nwhatever in the internet, but is dificult to educate ourselves around other \nmatters. It is just boring  and that is why we don't).\nFinally, if these people actually pee in a bucket and then pour it on \nthemselves we can save water and i bet watching the whole thing will be \nmore fun and bring awereness too . Else, throw themselves in the ocean as \nRyan's friend did which is actually cooler  cause it saves water and has \nsome shock value also:-p\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"The thing is that a lot of people do it and they don't even know what ALS \nis still, other than its a disease and they are dumping water on their head \nfor it.

aS'Actually, one of the main problems about the Ice Bucket Challenge isn\'t \nbecause it wastes water or as such, but because people are doing it just to \ndo it. They\'re not doing it to spread awareness of ALS. Instead, they are \ndoing it because their friends and famous celebrities are performing the \nIce Bucket Challenge. To them, it\'s a trend. To them, it\'s not to help \npeople diagnosed with ALS. I admit that I didn\'t know what ALS was until I \nheard of the Ice Bucket Challenge, and I heard about the Ice Bucket \nChallenge from a classmate of mine. What really makes me frustrated was the \nfact that my fellow peer did not know SHIT about ALS. She happily exclaimed \nthat she was going to donate and pour the bucket of ice over herself, but \nwhen I asked her what it was, she just shrugged and said something along \nthe lines of: "some illness or whatever that people have". I asked other \npeople; they all didn\'t know. This supposed action to help those with ALS \nhas died like a trend. Lasted about a month. Just like a trend. People \ndon\'t give a shit about it anymore. Just like a trend.\xef\xbb\xbf'

But it's easy \nto not dump fucking water on your head. And if water is being wasted, why \nthe fuck would you increase the water wastage? The amount of water that has \nbeen dumped on peoples heads would save millions of children all around the \nworld from having to walk for hours to get dirty water to drink little \namounts of for the next few days.\n\nDebate settled. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Ryan forgot the claim that the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge takes away national \nand media attention from the situation in Ferguson, along with the Michael \nBrown case, a claim which I completely agree with. The Ice Bucket Challenge \nis most definitely taking the spotlight away from Ferguson, postponing a \nlot of realization for the American People and in a way, stopping any \nfurther occurrences from making It\'s way to the public eye, certainly not \nstopping any more fatally violent attacks from officers there. I don\'t care \nwhether or not the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is a helpful thing to do, nor \ndoes it matter who donates or does it or if that establishes it\'s \n"lameness", I just think it\'s taking a lot away from the protestors and \nvictims in Ferguson and kind of stopping any reactions from the media or \ncountry in it\'s tracks.

aS'Well, the Ice bucket challenge is a very good way to raise awareness to \npeople about ALS. The big problem is, in some countries, it just became a \ntrend because celebrities do it, that the purpose of the premise becomes \ndenied of its actual purpose. Some just do this to have fun, or make people \nlaugh, or just do it because of the "I dare you to do this" kind of \nfeeling. It became like a chain letter of some sort. LOL. Meanwhile, they \ndon\'t really research on why the ice bucket challenge came up and how it\'s \nactually related to ALS, or what ALS really is. It\'s kind of sad to have \nthese kinds of people just throw away the importance of this cause. And \nthat\'s why you start to hate the people for neglecting that and not really \nthe challenge in itself. But what can anyone do? We don\'t really have any \ncontrol over these things. People are just people.. with different \nopinions, with different views. It\'s inevitable.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'So, I\'ve been reading the comments and people are saying " well, there\'s \nthe water cycle right? It\'s okay to waste water!!" Before I start to \ndestroy that stupid argument, I DO NOT THINK THAT ALS IS A WASTE OF WATER. \nNow that that\'s out of the way, let us begin. First off, do you know how \nmuch water agriculture uses? Sure, some people may argue that "The water \nvapour would still be released by the stomata!" Dude, logic. Not all water \nis going to be used by the plant and the remaining is stored as \ngroundwater. Anyways, agriculture uses lots of water. Countries have \nstarted to use water from rivers, etc. Second off, there aren\'t very much \ndrinkable water. Less than 1% is drinkable. And within that 1%, there are \ngroundwater, ice caps, glaciers, etc. Therefore, less than 0.5% of the \nworld\'s water is portable and drinkable. Now the main topic, \' Water Cycle\' \n. Let\'s say that on average, there is rainfall every week in your country. \nAnd the amount of rain produced is 100 000 000 cm(cube) every time it \nrains. This is still very little. Imagine there were 1 million people \nliving in your country. As an asian, there is an estimation of 100cm(cube) \nper week. Now let\'s look at the big pepsi bottle. That is 2.5 littres of \nwater. Therefore, per week, you would only receive about 4% of those. Yep, \n4% of one pepsi bottle to bathe and drink and clean, etc. Therefore, \nconsidering that one person uses 10 pepsi bottles a day, that country would \nneed 175 000 000 000 cm(cube) everytime it rained. Oh, and I have not \ngotten to the point where not all of the rain water is collected, water \nneeded to grow animals for food and lots more!!!! However, I am only 13 \nyears old and thus, I must say sorry in advance if some calculations or \ntheory were wrong. (Well, at least I\'m Asian, I got that goin for me, which \nis nice....) Sorry....\'----\'\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"This makes me happy that he made a video to those haters! My mother has ALS \nand I'm only 16 and I have to take care of her everyday, so no getting out \nand partying for me every night. And no, I'm not trying to make you feel \nsorry for me or to make it look like I'm a saint, but I think it's good \nthat more and more people know about ALS.\n\nAnd any rude comments will be flagged :)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p641
aS'Thank "god" for this video, hope some haters learned something.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p642
aS"I don't support the ALS charity bc they support embryonic research which is \nequivalent to supporting abortion. I am devastated they were given the \namount of money they received. There are many other charities for ALS that \nhave better moral standards. So there are very valid reasons to not support \nthe ice bucket challenge.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"I grew up in a third world country, but i dont think using one bucketful of \ncold water is gonna end the world...i mean how many of you think about \nsaving water when you prank people with water? Or keep the tap turned on \nwhen you're only looking at yourself in the mirror?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p649
aS' Every single person that disliked this hates ALS\xef\xbb\xbf'
p650
aS"Only %7 goes to actual research. This means that out of the 100$ that you \ndonated only 7 will go for the research. I'm not trying to bash on the \nchallenge, but it's something you need to keep in mind.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'You dont waist water it eventually evaporates \xef\xbb\xbf'
p658
aS'The ice bucket challenge used ice water because it gives you the feeling of \nwhat people with ALS have\xef\xbb\xbf'
p659
aS"I don't hate the ice-bucket challenge. I just find it respectfully \npointless. Firstly, if you dump a bucket of ice-cold water on your head and \ndonate 10 dollars instead of donating 100 dollars, then whether you donate \nthe ten or the hundred, how is the bucket making a difference to people \nwith ALS? Secondly, every little bit of money counts, whether it's 1 cent \nof 1,000,000 gran, so all you really need to do is donate the money without \nthe water, and it doesn't have to be only ten or a hundred, it could be any \nsum, because, as Ryan pointed out in the video above, it's just really a \ndonation.\nSo the money is all that really matters anyway.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p660
aS'I agree with the 3 people below, but still I like the idea for it Ryan...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p661
aS'most ice bucket challenges are made by people who dont even know it is for \ncharity, and no they also dont give publicity to charity, actually most \npublicity is by haters who complain that they are not donating and dont \nknow what it is about .... so yeah i dont agree with it, but i do like the \nfact that it STARTED as a charity. Also... third world is a term we should \nnot use anymore, i am from mexico.... used to be called like that and now \npeople decided to call second and third worlds developing countries... and \nNO we dont need cinamon and luckily we dont need water and YES we have \ninternet and can watch your videos online, is not only FW (or first world) \ncountries that can. not trying to complain much here but i see too much of \nFW and TW on this newest videos...\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I love that people are willing to do this challenge and donate.  But my \nquestion is.  Does the money that we donate REALLY go towards finding a \ncure or rather just goes towards the organization that we are donating to? \n Will admit that ALS, and all other diseases are a HORRIBLE thing.  And \nthat we must find a cure as soon as possible, but when we donate to these \norganizations we need to make sure that the money we are donating is \nactually going towards high end research....and not just used to run \norganization or association.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Can we focus on the problems in America for once? If your gonna complain \nabout people in Africa needing water, there are tons of american family\'s, \norphans and homeless people who have no food or water. And its not like \nthey are basically all dead over there they survived for hundreds of years \nwithout our help, they know how to live off the land. Yes, its amazing to \nhelp other countries and do good deeds for people in need, but if the \npeople in your own country aren\'t even satisfied and taken care of, and you \nprefer to complain about an awareness fund that raises money that stays in \nthe united states then obviously your "concern" for other countries is just \nfalse preachings to make yourself look better. Thank you very much. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I can't believe what I read here as this exactly the problem with so many \npeople these days. Ego is an illness of the modern age.

p694
aS'There is nothing wrong with doing something like the ice bucket challenge \nfor charity. But when people do it so they can "feel better". About \nthemselves it gets sort of old. "hmm im too fucking lazy to actually donate \nand help so ill just dump a bucket of ice water on my head and call it \ngood." And no I didn\'t donate or do the ice bucket challenge, probably \nnever will. And not all people are like this, there are people who do it \nbecause its a fad and their friends are doing it, and there are others who \ndo it for the best of reasons. Don\'t clump everyone into a specific \ncategory of "haters" and "non haters". Yes the ice bucket challenge did \nwhat it was supposed to do, generate awareness. Does the money go where it \nshould? Who knows? Does a company need to pay its employees? Yes. Do they \nneed to pay them a shit ton? Probably not. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p695
aS'So Right.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p696
aS'another thing people will complain about is "you shouldnt tag people \nwithout asking cuz they may not be financially able to donate, and when \npeople see that I haven\'t gone through with it than they will say \nsomething." or "its stupid cuz people shouldnt be forced to do that kinda \nstuff".\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'He talk to fast\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I think raising money for a charity is great, however I would not choose to \nsupport ALS because of their testing on animals.

aS'why do people pretend that perfect grammar on the internet is important?'
p165
aS'Word placement usually falls under grammar. The reason for this is due to \nthe way our written language is set up. (U.S. form of English) In proper \ngrammar, you are supposed to place your words carefully so it flows much \neasier when spoken aloud. You can say "bad English" is slang for "incorrect \nuse of English." In proper written English there is not supposed to be \nslang unless widely accepted by administration of many institutes.'
p166

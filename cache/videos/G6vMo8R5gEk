p10
aS'You sound like Justin Beiber T^T\xef\xbb\xbf'
p11
aS"This video is so cute <3\nHaha it's funny, just recently a friend of mine told me how she has noticed \nthat when (mostly) men get sick they always act like they are close to \ndying and try to get sympathy by letting everyone know how bad they feel \nand by overacting (no sexism intended, just her observation^^)- it kinda \nseems like Ryan was doing the same here and that's actually *really* \nadorable xDD\xef\xbb\xbf"
p12
aS'Most straight guys I know don\'t like clubs.  One of the cool things about \nbeing gay is that clubbing is much more fun.  None of that girls getting in \nfree.  The music is loud, but having conversations is very intimate, \ntalking loudly in some hot guy\'s ear with our faces rubbing together and \nour arms touching.\n\nDancing is awesome, because that\'s a good place to just start dancing with \na hot guy, flirt, dance sexy with him, and if you\'re lucky he\'ll dance sexy \nback (Grind On Me!) \n\nAnd I love dance music, and I love prepping for the night with my friends, \nand peaking on the dancefloor to my favorite song! ("Need a Friend" by \nCalippo.) \n\nAnyway, I know not all straight guys hate clubs and I have gay friends that \nwon\'t come clubbing.  Couples sometimes party, but not that often.  And I \nhave to admit that I haven\'t been in a straight club in a long time.  So I \ndon\'t really have first-hand knowledge of what they\'re like right now.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'So true...\nman fuck clubs, clubs are for couples not single people, if you go to a \nclub searching to "get laid" you will end up spending all night stressing \nout and doing nothing, spending about 100$ and still getting nowhere.\nclubs are not a place for single people, that\'s just how it is... why? \nbecause single people doesn\'t usually look like models (Ryan... mhm), and \nif they are, they wont go letting people rub over them... so the result is, \na lot of unattractive people jumping all over eachother, everybody is \nrepulsed by the other, and no one getting nowhere.\nso as I said, clubs are for couples, and I\'m not talking like 2 people, I\'m \ntalking about 3+ group of couples... but still the clubs are filled with \ncrawling too horny people, so you end up still not finding it fun.\nclubs are for show off, movies, videos, pictures, it\'s not really fun...\npoint is... fuck clubs man, private parties with friends ftw.\nteehee\xef\xbb\xbf'

S'I\'m 13 and I take pills for my ADHD, so before watching the video I\'ll list \nmy stuff. My personal examples are how people are often like "Steven stop \nshaking your foot." You know like I\'m always sort of fidgeting part of my \nbody. Sometimes I move on to another thought mid-sentence, but that "Hey \nman so how are-OH SHINY" stuff is BS. I\'m bad with names, but I doubt it\'s \ndue to my ADHD. I sometimes try to focus on reading like for tests and \nstuff but then I don\'t even know what I\'m reading halfway thru the \nparagraph. Sometimes I start gazing off into the distance while talking to \nmy friends, simulate pesky listening to my friends and thinking about \nsomething. People think I\'m thinking about something deep but usually I\'m \njust thinking about how I should wit my next sentence. I spend a ton of \ntime stressing about memorizing something and I make songs for it, but then \nI mix the songs with actually songs and forget. I have my most creative \nideas in the shower and often spend up to an hour standing there thinking. \nI often fixate on one thing, and all my ideas lead back to it. A lot of \npeople think that people with ADHD would be vocal about their thought \nprocess, but I often just stare blankly while thinking really hard, making \nme look like a dumbass when trying to play puzzle games. People who say \nthey have ADHD piss me off because I\'m like "since when is it cool to have \na disorder f off man" Ok, seeing as how I\'m always mind blown when people \nonline relate to me, I\'m about to watch the video. Hopefully I can relate \nto Ryan and hopefully I\'ll feel less\nyknow\nTotally insa-OOO SHINY\xef\xbb\xbf'
p10
aS"OMG like am so scared right now, i have ADHD i 100% do. I din't even knew \nwhat that was until now, i think that's not even a thing in Serbia..\xef\xbb\xbf"
p11
aS'So LOL I have ADHD then, ok the goodbye dream of being a normal human, it \nwas nice knowing you\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS'http://psychcentral.com/cgi-bin/addquiz.cgi Its the adhd test if ound after \nwatching the video, unforunately i scored 29/34\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS'update to my comment it turns out i have strong A.D.D which is A.D.H.D \nwithout the H\xef\xbb\xbf'
p14
aS'I relate to most of these... oh shit\xef\xbb\xbf'
p15
aS'I was always the silent one until i was 13 since i became 13 all of those \nthings happen to me (but i was never tested or anything)\xef\xbb\xbf'
p16
aS'Nobody told me I had ADHD. Yet, most of the things Ryan said applies to me.\n\nIs it possible for ADHD to come after birth? Or is it a birth defect? If I \nhad it since birth, is it possible for the doctor not to know?\nOr is it to not know?\nIt kind of sounds like " to not no ". Backwards, it\'s "ontonot"\' which kind \nof sounds like "on the dot". Why do they call it " on the dot " anyway? \nIt\'s like as if... oh wait a second. My mother made coffee.\n\nEdit: My mother is lecturing me now. Might as well type down what she says. \nCoffee has caffeine that can either make some people sleep or awake. She \nnever did her research so some of the information may not be reliable. \nWait, should I stare at her nose or mouth or eyes? It looks like she has an \neyeball in her mouth... what?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p17
aS'OH NO! SUDDENLY EVERYONE IN THE COMMENTS SECTION WAS "ACTUALLY" DIAGNOSED \nWITH ADHD WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE! However can we stop this sudden ADHD \noutbreak! But seriously though, don\'t lie. Just because some of these \nthings apply to you, doesn\'t mean that you have ADHD. Also, lying about \nADHD in the comments doesn\'t bring you attention.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p18
aS"Oh My God almost all these apply yo me. I have ADHD!!!!!!!!\xf0\x9f\x98\xadbut wait that \nproves I'm a demigod!\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xef\xbb\xbf"
p19
aS'I do everything in this video but my doctor hasnt diagnosed me? So is it \nnot that serious, or does he not notice it? My sister has it and she doesnt \nshow many of these, im just confused right now. Can someone help me out \nhere?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p20
aS"nigachinka, you said it, you aint no doctor, and you said don't make adhd \nyour excuse if you did bad in school. just sttfu, please, like dear ryan: \ngo jump off a cliff. because sometimes you think you are soo smart but \nreally, you don't know how people with adhd think so stfu because i have \nadhd and my grades went from high to low since i was diagnosed so go die.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p21
aS'I have 12 of those things.\n1:21 1:26 1:56 2:08 2:13 2:23 2:27 2:33 2:36 2:59 3:09 3:13\xef\xbb\xbf'
p22
aS'I can relate to about half of them like forgetting what im about say i do \nthat a lot \xef\xbb\xbf'
p23
aS'Hey did anyone else notice 5318008? Put it in a calculator flip it upside \ndown and you got 80081E5 or Boobies\xef\xbb\xbf'
p24
aS"hey i have a question to the ADHD community. in the 8th grade i started \ntaking meds to help me focus and calm down but after a while i started \ngetting depressed and a lower dosage wasn't working. so i stopped taking it \nand felt soooo much better. my question is.... did this happen to any of \nyou (getting depressed or mean... or both?)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p25
aS"Wow...for the longest time, looking back on my younger days, I thought I \nwas just stupid and lazy and just dumb when it came everything except \ndrawing. I always got bad grades because I just couldn't focus on studying \nand stuff. I really thought I was just stupid. But I like relate with a lot \nof the stuff you explained about in the video...that is both very \ninteresting and concerning because now I'm wondering if ADHD can get WORSE \nas you get older because I'm in college now and things have not gotten \nbetter as far as studying has gone. I've actually failed about 3 classes \nand barely squeak by in my non-Art classes with just D's and C's.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p26
aS'...So... I really have ADHD ?.... I thought it was normal to do all these \nthings......... Everything makes sense now......\xef\xbb\xbf'
p27
aS"This is like me but i dont cheat in school and get a's and one b every once \nin a while\xef\xbb\xbf"
p28
aS'oh my gosh i have it!! yesturday mum told me to get her purse to buy KFC \n(after viet school) and then she bought stuff then handed it bak to me then \ni went to get my phone in my viet bag and afterwards she stopped at the \nshops to buy bananas but she couldnt find her purse and i threw stuff \neverywhere onj the car to find i put it in my viet bag even though i dont \nremember doing so XD when people ask me what my fav song is i cant think \nbut if they dont ask i keep saying all these songs by the cab. also if they \nteel me to sing a song i forget the lyrics. when im at church after taking \nthe bread thing, we kneel and thank god or something, i think about god \nthen i think what he does, does he have houses up there? can he eat? is \nthere a ground in heaven, is it clouds as ground? are there clouds above \nheaven??? do god float above ground or does he actually walk? does he feel \nthings? does he even do anything? can he see us all? can he see me in the \nshower??!! O.o hes i think i got it :C also on the car to school, mum and \nmy big sis have conversations but i never ever hear what they say unless \nthey yell my name cuz im thinking about random stuff. i always miss out on \ninteresting things they say. or i wanted to go to the toilet but for some \nreason i ended up in the study room, or when i tried to find my pencil but \nim holding it..... my friends were laughing at me.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p29
aS'I think I might have ADHD...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p30
aS'I dont have adhd but I have ADD. Its olmost the same. But i dont know the \ndiffrent.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p31
aS'I have A.D.H.D. and take a pill for it every morning. I hate when people \ncan relate to some of this and think "Oh shit I have ADHD" NO. There\'s a \nlot more to it than just this video.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p32
aS'Mom told me to get her a glass of ice water.\nHad to make 8 trips back and forth forgetting each time what she wanted. \n\nThats not ADHD thats just sad. xD\xef\xbb\xbf'
p33
aS'Damn, I didn\'t know this is ADHD, but so far I\'ve watched half of the video \nand noticed that the same was happening with me ALL THE TIME! Just exactly \neverything!! WTF is going on! For so many years I was frustrated, that I \nalways forget something, that I time travel or that I need at least 3 times \nto go somewhere, because every time I come back, I take everything with me \nexcept that thing. And exams are so hard, because no matter how hard I \nstudy, I am way too calm on the exam, thinking about other things and when \nI have to write it, I am just like "..." in my head and that I am always \nundecided even about the smallest things, though other people don\'t bother \nso much. wow, thanks! Now I know what is happening!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p34
aS'Yeah I was diagnosed with it when I was little\xef\xbb\xbf'
p35
aS'XD "the hell are all these things"\xef\xbb\xbf'
p36
aS"For those people who think you do have ADHD, it's not an excuse, it's just \nthat you have more difficulty paying attention.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p37
aS"hehehheheheh omg thank youuuuuuuuuuuu now i know atleast i dont \nhave alzheimer,,, i was so afraid about that having alzheimer and i'm only \n22 years old ,, shit !\xef\xbb\xbf"
p38
aS'I forgot what I was gonna comment.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p39
aS"Well now I know I'm as  just as messed up in the head as Ryan. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p40
aS"Great vid, man. You could've talked a little faster though, cuz..you \nknow....\nTHERE'S NO TIME!!! WE HAVE TO GET TO THE NEXT THING!!\n\nWhere are my pants?!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p41
aS'i had no idea i had ADHD before this video damn Ryan u aint a doctor but \nyou r better than one\xef\xbb\xbf'
p42
aS'+Midas no Magika +The Warrior Bug  i just subbed this guy he made me laugh \n1:34 btw i only have a.d.d i dont have the hyperactive so most of these \nsymptoms are my problems XD\xef\xbb\xbf'
p43
aS'thez taingz applie 2 mei 2 yoghu \nidk why im typing llike that i just want to stop typing oh im still typing \n:/ my arms ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh noonez gonna read this anyways like me i would \nnever re.....what the hell am i doing? seriously? \xef\xbb\xbf'
p44
aS"lol ! a lot of these happen to me... but the \xc2\xabproblem\xc2\xbb is that i have good \ngrades anyways... but im really not able to listen in class, during a \nmovie, when i talk to someone etc... im always over thinking and not \nnecaraly about what is happening or what i should be thinking about anyway. \nI don't/can't read long text from school... i only skim (sometime) the 1st \nsentence of each paragraph and i logically make up the rest... which, up \ntill now always worked for me! hope it'll continue that way for ever !!! So \nwhen i look up ADHD and they  basically say that u have to have bad grades \nto confirm that u actually have it... well... i guess  don't ...according \nto them but im sure there's something going on anyway!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p45
aS'I got 19 of these, hmm.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p49
aS'if that is what its really like having ADHD then this video made me more \nsure that ADHD isnt a real disorder\xef\xbb\xbf'
p50
aS'Nigahiga Im no expert on ADHD but, it relates to implusive behavior, ADD, \netc. its an accual neurological condition such as reversing a stimulant\xef\xbb\xbf'
p51
aS'I just took a test to see if I was ADHD and I guess I am in fact I thought \nI just had ADD but I do everything he talks about and I took a test and it \nonly took me like 5 minutes it was pretty short \nhttp://psychcentral.com/addquiz.htm\xef\xbb\xbf'
p52
aS'Omfg! I have ADHD ! D: \xef\xbb\xbf'
p53
aS'And i thought i was the only one.....\xef\xbb\xbf'
p54
aS'Those r spodders\xef\xbb\xbf'
p55
aS"WTF? All this time I thought it was normal to do that \xf0\x9f\x98\xad! Literally all of \nthem are just like me and when you said the rap part I got distracted in my \nhead by making another rap .... FML! <- look at that! Who does that \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9? No \none needed to know but oh well! I'm still gonna comment anyways :p ( I did \nit again! I keep typing WTF pure adhd \xf0\x9f\x98\xa2) <- smh \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xef\xbb\xbf"
p56
aS'If anyone else has this problem, please comment because when I tried to \nexplain it to my friend and they didn\'t believe me.\n\nI can find practically anything funny because one joke someone cracks, \nleads to multiple other thoughts that ends up making it funny.\n\nEX: I was watching a video about meth addicts and when the guy was having a \nseizure I couldn\'t help but think,\n he would be attractive if his eyes weren\'t rolled up, which made me think \nabout zombies, which made me think about marring a zombie, which made me \nthink of my vows to him, "I married you cause your eyes are pretty", which \nmade me think about saying that to a normal person as a pick-up line, which \nmade me think "Even if you are hit by a truck, you are fine as long as your \neyes are pretty", which somehow made me laugh, and by the time I realized I \nwas laughing, everyones eyes are on me, and I\'m laughing at a guy lying on \nthe floor (in a video) having a seizure...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p57
aS'But what is pi? It is the life. The life of pi is a life without pie. Pie \nis only one letter from pi. The E in pie symbolizes eBay which is where \ngeeks buy cool things, geeks are associated with math, which includes pi... \n3.14... An infinite number... The opposite of infinity i- oh look, a \nbutterfly!!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p58
aS'I pretty much know i dont have ADHD, but i can relate to almost all of \nthose examples\xef\xbb\xbf'
p59
aS'Ryan, you just diagnosed me with ADHD.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p60
aS'first way to know if you have ADHD: Are you watching this video when you\'re \nsupposed to be doing something else. If you answer "yes" you probably have \nADD or ADHD\xef\xbb\xbf'
p61
aS'Everything here is me, should I trust this guy and ask about treatment?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p62
aS"When ever I take meds for ADHD I'm always super shy and I never eat. Am I \nthe only one?.....(probably)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p63
aS' I officially have ADHD, I related to 17 out of 20 of these examples. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p64
aS'Wow, I thought everyone was doing this stuff! My whole life is a lie. I \nvaguely remember being diagnosed as "hyperactive-something" as a kid, but \nnever put much thought to it. Didn\'t know there are pills for it either. I \njust thought others take stuff too seriously and lack imagination. Am I \nweird?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p65
aS"95% of the people here don't have shit.. and that is exactly the problem.. \nbut it's ok.. keep telling yourself that so that you cope with your lack of \neffort or laziness or just because you fall under the ilussion that these \nthings happen to you. Let me explain these thing happen to EVERYONE!!! and \nthat why everyone can relate, however, most people lack the experiecne or \nthe perception to TRULY know what it is to live with this experiences.. \nit's truly horrible to have ADHD, lie me, when you sit in a room, even \nright know my head is thinking a million things, sometimes I even feel like \ncrying because I can't make it stop, that's how it feels.. and one more \nthing.. yes, there's some typical behaviour but in reality every persons \nwith TRUE adhd has their own ways of dealing with it and even experience \nit. in Any case I'll probably have many replies arguing with what I just \nsaidm but it's fine.. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p66
aS"If you look at infinity sideways, you see an eight, which is the number of \nletters in nigahiga. Sideways, is how a crab walks, but if we walked \nsideways we wouldn't be able to see. But we would still be able to see our \nreflection in the sea. Wait reflection...eight is a mirror reflection of \ntwo threes, and in Japanese, three is pronounced the same as mountain. A \nmountain, a vantage point where you can see things in an infinite amount of \nperspectives, sideways or not. And the mystery is solved, on top of a \nmountain is where Ryan gets all his inspiration!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p67
aS"I try not to think that I have ADHD because I think I have some of this \nstuff but I'm not sure because I can't focus on one topic and drift off \ninto another.. Which is probably why I'm bad at writing because I write \nfrom narratives to lions.. Then I always think of Simba or that Lion King \nMovie.. And wondering how the king died again and here I go ranting again \nand I forgot what I was also going to say..\xef\xbb\xbf"
p68
aS'I have ADHD, I did not know that\xef\xbb\xbf'
p69
aS'Damn every thing he said i could not have said it better my self \xef\xbb\xbf'
p70
aS'2:04 why would anyone be thinking of Chimpanzees taking a piss? Out of all \nthe million things in the world, we think about Chimpanzees taking a urine \nexpulsion? Why not think about Gorillas having sex?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p71
aS'so true, thanks for making this..are you me?? How did you get inside my \nhead? \xef\xbb\xbf'
p72
aS'I know I have ADHD and a slight autism I was diagnosed as a kid and I even \ntook medicine which was a huge mistake \xef\xbb\xbf'

That is until I heard him \nsay something about a butterfly. When I heard that I ignored everything and \nlooked at the youtube video.

Or even something simple like the \nthought falling down on a bike, I imagine it and then try to imagine me \nriding a bike normally and I keep on falling down the same exact way over \nand over and over. When I was watching this vid and I was trying to see if \nI could do the "freestlye" thing I kept on thinking about something for \nhalf a millisecond then going to a blank thing then going to a random thing \nsomehow related to something or what not and then going back to a blank \narea and never being able to do anything unless I\'m thinking about doing \nnothing and also thinking about everything and nothing.

aS"Thank you for making this video! Even though ADHD jokes don't bother me, I \nstill hate that they make people oversimplify what it means to have it. \nPlus, there's the fact that people can have it at totally different levels, \nor with different combinations of symptoms. Though I find it really cool \nhow many random things you can find in common between yourself in another \nperson with ADHD. :) \nI always kinda thought that I got distracted the same way other people did, \nonly more so. It's such a strange thought, to think that other people can \nactually sit down and get their homework done in an hour or two. Or that it \nisn't normal to completely forget what you were saying in mid-sentence, and \nthen just stop talking. \nI hate that some people think ADHD is just an excuse for laziness or unruly \nbehavior, when I would give anything to find a medication that actually \nworks and makes my brain stay on track so that I don't spend so much time \ndoing everything.\nAnyway. Meant to keep this short, but failed... Thank you for making this \nvideo!\xef\xbb\xbf"

p543
aS"I don't have ADHD but I do 3/4 of these. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p544
aS"I have ADHD and most of this is pretty spot on.  However, I have learned to \ncontrol it; mostly.  But that control gives me advantages over so many \npeople.  It is nice to be able to think about 3 different things at the \nsame time as a minimum.  But I have taken it to the extreme and I can type \non thing, read another, and listen to someone else all at the same time.  \nBut it can be a pain sometimes. \n\nHowever, because I have learned to control it and understand how it works \nbetter, I can tell you, it isn't a disorder.  The problem is... in a world \nhammers and nails, you are the one born with a jigsaw.  Since nobody wants \nto learn how the jigsaw works, they all think it doesn't work well.  Never, \ndo they realize, the jigsaw can do so much more than the hammer and nails \ncan; just you need to learn how to use the hammers and nails to make what \nyou do understandable by others and it can increase the effectiveness of \nyour work because you have more tools.  And then you blow people's minds \nwhen you show them, the hammer can hammer more than just nails.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p549
aS'Hmm... \xef\xbb\xbf'
p550
aS'I related to 20 of those\xef\xbb\xbf'
p551
aS"I can relate to most of these. Like the reading 5 pages then has no idea to \nwhat they talk about so I have to reread it like 5 times before I \nunderstand. I take really long breaks while on facebook or smthing and I \ncan be very forgetful. But honestly, despite all of those, I can still get \ngood grades and I'm in honor classes so It's twice as hard as the regular \nclasses. My only advice is With the necessary effort you can accomplish \nanything despite ADHD. I've never taken drugs and I've had any problem in \nschool. Smhow I cant seem to focus when the teacher is explaining cuz ny \nthoughts are always somewhere else but I go and see the teacher or ask \nquestions after class. I also work twice as hard as a regular kid. I always \nask for extra work to make sure that I understand well. With that said, \nanything is possible as long as you work hard for it. You have to give your \n100% and remember to never do the minimum cuz unlike the other kids you \nhave to work twice as hard to get the same they do. If they study 30mins \neveryday you have to study for an hour to learn the same thing. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p552
aS"Related to everything but one, once I was talking on the phone in my \nbasement when I ended my call I was in my room on the top floor, I don't \nknow how I got there! Lol\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I do all of these things\xef\xbb\xbf'
p570
aS'HOLY CRAP I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH IT AND ALL OF THESE ARE REAL\xef\xbb\xbf'
p571
aS"I used to be an intern at an elementary school in the Netherlands, before i \nfound out being a teacher is not my thing. That was pretty much 10 years \nago i think. Anyway, that was during the ADHD crisis, anyone who acted \nslightly more active then the others were automatically diagnosed with \nADHD. There was this kid in class, 7 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD, \ni told the teacher that he didn't act like he had it, but no i was wrong \ncause she told me i could not know that (gee thanks _). So i observed the \nkid for a few days, what i found out was that this kid finished all his \nwork in like 1/3 the amount of time others needed. I checked what he made \nand it was, well except for minor mistakes, very good. The kid was far \nahead of the others but was treated by teachers like he was an anoying brat \nwho could not do shit. Because he was far ahead but did not get any \nstimulance he was bored out of his skull and didn't know how to fill that \ngap of boredom, behaviour which was very recognisable from my own \nexperience.\n\nI too was bored out of my skull, and pretty much was drawing stuff 50% of \nthe time in elementary school. Never got stimulance, never got the idea to \ndo anything for school was what i was taught basically, which in later \nyears cost me a lot of time catching up cause i didn't do shit. I myself am \nfrom the Autism era, everyone who acted like they were not a pre-programmed \nR2-unit was labeled autistic (i'm not autistic btw :P). It is the job of \nteachers to give stimulus to children so they can learn. But they love \nputting labels on kids so they don't have to do anything special. The ADHD \nlabel seems very popular worldwide, don't believe schools immediatly about \nthese things, they are lazy fucks who just don't want to do any extra work.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Im sure all this applies to everybody.\nBecause I experience most of these things myself and i believe i dont have \nADHD.\nNot that i went to the doctor and checked but i know i dont have one.\nAnd if I do have one then that means society is oblivious that 50 pecent of \nus have ADHD.\nAnd plus ADHD has a similarity with lazy people.People whom are lazy tend \nto slack around and ignore many factors that needs to be \naccomplish.Also,those whom have difficulty remembering things are because \nof the fact that it isnt important enough to you!And as like my teacher \nwould say,why didnt u forget to wear your shirt and shorts to scjool \ntoday?LOL but seriously you guys are over thinking things.\nIt doesnt matter if you have it or not,it only matter if you want to make a \ndifference!And if you cant due to whatever condition you consist,then try \nrelying on a technology or a friend or something alike!\nYou are still humans,capable of doing big things like this man over here.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"ADHD isn't that bad, in fact I believe children are just being diagnosed \nwith ADHD only because the pills make it so you can control them easier. \nKids are pretty hyperactive, only because they are kids and they have so \nmuch energy compared to adults or even teenagers. To an extent all these \nsymptoms are normal. I have a friend who is ADHD and she legitly can't keep \nher mind on one specific task, she always forgets to do an assignment as \nwell, even though her classes are not in the same difficulty as mine. I \nalso have another friend with this disorder and I once tried to tutor him \nand even then it was difficult because everything distracted him. He takes \nmedication and that makes him all depressed and stuff like that.\xef\xbb\xbf"

If i clean my house i can't find ANYTHING \ndespite trying to actively remember where everything is as i clean and \nhaving specific places for them. i then proceed to trash my house \nfrantically looking for my stuff. And then go into a lazy depression \nbecause my house is filthy within 2 days of cleaning it. :( the only thing \ni can do is recall names (if i have something to relate it to like sera, \nsarah from land before time, or stephany from...that...movie with the robot \nthat has feelings named number 5.....fuck well there's a good example of me \nhaving bad memory ETC)\xef\xbb\xbf"

p917
aS"I think that to a certain extent most people have a little ADHD, but don't \nreally need medication for it. Like I almost always do what he does, \nmeaning I take something someone says than have a long train of thoughts \nthat leads me to a different subject. My hands always move, and I usually \nmultitask work with pleasure(like watch nigahiga and do homework). That \nsaid I've always been top notch school wise, and when I get into a book you \ncan't get me out of it. It all depends of severity\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Omg! Everything he said, happens to me. Like my whole life I'd get \nirritated with myself because i couldn't focus, or I'd lose my train of \nthought. . My fiance also tells me i get distracted a lot but i don't even \nnotice it do I'll argue against it. Sometimes i don't even know what I'm \nsaying and I'm confusing others as i confuse myself. . if that makes any \nsense? . . Now, I'm not going to diagnose myself by watching a you tube \nvideo, pffft who would do that? I do, however, have family who has ADHD. \nCould it genetically passed on in family? I need to see a doctor. . . \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9 \xef\xbb\xbf"

p924
aS'Yeah thank you very much.\nWouldn\'t be here if I didnt already suspect I had ADHD. At the beginning of \nthe video, before you started listing things, I was pretty sure, but not \nconvinced. Then every single thing you said fit in, not once in a while, \nbut pretty much every minute of every day. The rant at the end is what \nreally drove it home though.That\'s how I fall asleep. I can never just fall \nasleep cause there\'s always something I\'m thinking about, and going on \nlittle "mind rants" like that keeps me from focusing on a specific thing, \nand therefor helps me sleep.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p925

The one that I got the most kick out of was \nthe when you're talking to someone and you suddenly get distracted by what \nyou usually look at when you're talking to someone (like, which eye or \nnose?) that part I could relate to so so much haha. great video!

p960
aS"ok well then i guess i have adhd then......ya kinda do everything that he \nsays on this video...... not proud but it keeps me hyper and it keeps me \nfrom being a slack. people say that adhd makes you lazy but to me and my \nfriend who are actually diagnosed with it, we view it as a stress reliever \nor a brain work out. because we move to relieve stress from the constant \nthinking that your brain does in order for us to be productive in our day \nto day life. SO in my opinion i don't think it should be called adhd....... \nmaybe we should call it........adh.......ya i have no idea where to go with \nthis but still i don't think this should be classified as a disorder, \nBECAUSE it has proven useful in day to day life for us.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'i related to 12 things\xef\xbb\xbf'
p974
aS"What most people don't seem to understand is that if things like these \nhappen to you here and there or sometimes it really doesn't make you have \nADHD. If it interferes with your daily life so much that it makes \neverything harder than it's supposed to be, you probably have ADHD. Saying \nthat you have ADHD isn't quirky or cute and there's nothing fun about being \nso forgetful that bad things keep happening, that most of your free time \ngoes to doing stuff others can do in short amounts of time etc. I got \ndistracted three times while writing this text post and forgot every time \nwhat I was going to write next or what I had written earlier. When I post \nthis, I have read this at least six times to be sure that I didn't make big \nmistakes. It's not like I could spot them because I can't concentrate \nenough to notice small mistakes. That's what it feels like.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p975
aS'I have the infinite thought thing. For example I will freestyle this too. \nWhat about 1? We have too but no 1. But if 1 +2 is 3 that confirmed half \nlife 3. Why half life? Why not full life or just life? Did the character \nget hit by a train before starting the game and that\'s why he has only half \nhis health? But he was hit by a train. Which is what Bruno Mars was hit by \nin his song "grenade". Maybe the main character in half life was Bruno Mars \nall along? Maybe Bruno comes from mars? Maybe that\'s how he got his name \nand was famous for being the first man on Mars? What if there is another \nBruno called Bruno earth or Bruno Jupiter? Maybe the brunos take over our \nsolar system? Idk where I\'m going with this xD\xef\xbb\xbf'

p1045
aS'I see a lot of posts where people are asking if they have ADD and/or ADHD. \n if your married, the best way is to ask your spouse, via these \nquestions/examples.  \n\nI\'m now 67, and I got in trouble at work, when I was 50, for not staying on \ntask.  I saw a professional, a phycologist who was with ADD.  He started \nasking me questions for about 10 or 15 minutes, then he started talking to \nmy wife.  I was getting a little hot because I was thinking I was the one \nwith the issue, not my wife.  But, she was able to see things that I \ndidn\'t.  I have ADD (I\'m not ADD), and the first time I took Ritalin, it \nwas amazing how calm I felt.  I was a church and for the FIRST time I could \nlisten to what was being said.  It was wonderful.  I have three sons, two \nhave ADD, and one with ADD and depression, like me.  PLEASE, PLEASE \nremember, everybody is different. and a person with ADD/ADND are also \ndifferent.  My grandson is ADD and different from the rest of us.  Plus, \ndifferent medications work differently for different people.  My grandson \ncan\'t take Ritalin.  \n\nBefore I knew I had ADD, I studied for all my FAA written exams via self \ninstructional text.  I never took a ground school, and I never made below \n92 on any FAA test.  If treated correctly, ADD can be a blessing.  Google \n"famous people with ADD" and I think you\'ll be surprised.  The best to you.\n\nP.S. Because this guy speaks fast and acts hyper is very often NOT a part \nof ADHDl \xef\xbb\xbf'
p1046
aS'I was diagnosed, it sucked in school, but I\'m a graphic designer so it \nhelps with creativity sometimes....  Now the "what do I normally look at \nwhen someone\'s talking" made me crack up I thought I was the only one! \n It\'s ridiculous how I relate with everything you mentioned, and how I\'ve \ncome to just accept my perpetual ambivalence. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'i think i have ADHD\xef\xbb\xbf'
p1057
aS'I see that many of you have had bad experiences with medication. I dont \nknow about adHd but I have add: and medication has been my life line \nagainst depressions. The medication has helped me focus more and they are \nvery much the reason I came through school without dropping out a 4th time. \nI still struggle with focusing. But at least I get things done and I can \nread a page in a textbook and at least get something out of it. I have \nlearned how to make my brain learn things it doesnt really want to by using \ncoloured pencils and images in the process. But i could not have done it \nwithout my medication. It was like seeing the world with blurry lines and \nthen putting on glasses. Its easier to talk to people and do tasks at home. \nBefore the medication everything was out of focus. And even though i still \nhave symptoms when Im on the meds it doesnt bother me too much that the \nlight in the classroom buzzes unstoppably or that someone sits restlessly \non the chair next to me. And it is tons easier to have a conversation even \nif the focus sometimes drifts into another place. It is easier to get back \nwhere I want my focus to be. So I guess medication can work for someone. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p1058
aS"I don't know if I have ADHD but I am pretty sure I do have it and I do know \nfor sure my parents put me on Ritalin for my entire grade 5 and 6 years \nwhich I am pretty sure was over 8 years ago which when I asked my parents \nthey said they gave me Ritalin when I was in school, not to mention I get \ndistracted very easily all the time and I just stumble in my words almost \nall the time when talking to people or forget what I was going to say.\xef\xbb\xbf"

My interpretation of dopey is more calmer and slow, \nthough yeah my leg shakes and my head bobbles, but I do lose focus \nreallyyyy easily and I have that exact same thought process where I go from \nthing to thing. How can I actually get diagnosed for ADHD, to check if I \nreally have it?

aS'I don\'t know how but I related to everything, especially the thing where \nyou do something with your hands un-conciously. I flip pens all the time, \neither when I\'m thinking or daydreaming. I daydream a lot. Sometimes I like \nto think of the Wolverine. I never decide what type of angle his claws \nshould be at. Should they be complete 180 to give a sleet look? Or perhaps \nslightly angled to give a look of efficiency. Did you know that electric \ncars are more efficient than gas cars? Remember how we didn\'t even have gas \nas transportation fuel? We had coal! We still use coal in power plants. \nSome power plants use nuclear stuff nowadays. Ugh, remember that movie, \n"Superman IV? That Nuclear man character? Wow, so stupid! You know what, \nback to the topic at hand: daydreaming. Wait, if they say daydreaming, why \ndon\'t they also say night dreaming? Or walking into awake walking? They \nshould really say this in the dictionary. You know what, speaking of \ndictionaries, I thought of books, then I thought of reading. Then I thought \n"Hey, I should read instead of exploiting myself in a youtube comment." Bye \nbye. Ha ha, that sounded so childish. Why do grown-ups always talk in such \nweird fashions to kids? They\'re all like "wittle" and "wabbit". They sound \nlike Looney Toons characters. Man I love that show. Hey, what happened to \nold-fashioned.......\xef\xbb\xbf'

I think it was just an extreme case \nof OCD though. It's not as bad now... as I say alone in my room. Just... \ntyping... Oh look a butterfly!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p1275
aS"Am already diagnosed with ADHD but was curious about your video. And I \nwatched it right through! (Fortunately too, it loaded quickly which was \nalso a contributing factor ) Anyhoo, that you were able to make an ADHD \nvideo that lasted for 5 odd minutes that didn't seem that long - and I \nwatched it straight through without fast forwarding or rewinding it and \nwatched it to the end, was remarkable. It was so well done. So watchable. I \n(mentally) laughed and cried! I am a 52 year old female on the other side \nof the world but for all intents and purposes we may as well be sharing a \nbrain. Great stuff! \xef\xbb\xbf"
p1276
aS"What I hate more than people using ADHD as an excuse for laziness are the \ndoctors who always prescribe to children and their parents the medication \nas a 'solution'. People with high-functioning ADHD/ADD don't need meds \nbecause they do not have huge episodes like other people with a lower \nfunctionality.\n\nTake for example, I have aspergers (high-functioning autism). I do not \ndisplay the symptoms in a way that others that have autism. Rather, I \n(rarely) have issues with socializing or stopping myself from continuing a \ncertain activity. However, that is mostly because my mother refused to put \nme on medication, therefore, my aspergers did not progress. Others my age \nwho HAVE taken the medication for aspergers DO display low-severity \nsymptoms of the common autistic individual.\n\nIt's why I hate big corporate health districts. They always hire doctors \nand nurses that will pursue any excuse to shove drugs down your throat.\xef\xbb\xbf"

Being \nas it was when i started watching this i was playing around with my \nbutterfly knife....\n\nFor the people who say, after watching this, they think they have ADHD now, \nThere is another thing for that specific feeling, Basically it's your brain \ncausing a placebo effect within your conscious to feel that feeling, it may \nbe one thing to do some of this occasionally but when you do it every day \nof your life then it is real, None of this is bad its just how the body \nworks.\xef\xbb\xbf"

Ugh everyday it\'s the challenge of "what challenge can I climb \ntoday" but half way through, I stop and start something else... I have a \nlot if unfinished business but I can never decide on one thing to long \nwithout going to the next. I\'m surprised I didn\'t randomly go off into \nsomething meaningless while writing this. Which is very common. Mostly \npancakes, god I seriously love pancakes. Waffles are ok I suppose. Now back \nto staring at the lego party I just built with dj deadpool... Excuse me\xef\xbb\xbf'

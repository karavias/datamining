S'Dear Ryan, how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck \nwood?\n(Please answer scientifically)\nI really need to know.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p10
aS'LOL\xef\xbb\xbf'

p12
aS'I no longer need to go to school...u have taught me everything I need to \nknoe\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS"The chicken came first, cause how can an egg be made with out the chicken \n(mother).. but if you think about it... how did the fist chicken on this \nwhole earth come to life, their was no other chicken to create that one.. \nDAMB, that's a hard fucking question... :/\xef\xbb\xbf"
p14
aS'How do you pronounce nigahiga?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p15
aS"Dear Ryan, the chicken came first because God created the animals on the \n6th day, which was an adult chicken. Adam wasn't created as a newborn was \nhe? No, an adult. (Prepare for the scientologists to rage)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p16
aS'OMG the egg came first! Chickens evolved from something so that something \nlay an egg and from that egg evolved a chicken!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p17
aS"Egg = 12 chickens.\n1 egg hatches into 12 chicks...?\n\nOK, let's do this.\nIf the chicken wasn't there, where will the egg come from? If the egg \nwasn't there, the chicken can still lay an egg. But where does the chicken \ncome from? Eggs. So in order to have an egg, you need a chicken. For a \nchicken, you need an egg.\n\nSo, in conclusion, both the egg and the chicken came first in order for the \ncycle to begin.\n\nBut religion- wise, either can come first. But there must be two genders of \nchickens for a fertilized egg...\nSo there will either be two chickens of different genders or two eggs of \ndifferent genders.\n\nOH GOSH THIS IS CONFUSING.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p18

p26
aS"There's actually big flaw in this reasoning. There is no part in the \nnursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty that says he's an egg. Seriously, which part in \nthe nursery rhyme said that humpty dumpty was an egg?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p27
aNaS'Hu -> uh\nNumber 2\nIf god exists or not! If the universe is everything there is and god is \noutside he would never exist! Who created god? Nothing! So... God never \nexisted? Find out yourself! Annoying god believers... You have no proof \nabout the stupid adult chicken thing...\xef\xbb\xbf'

All the \nking\'s horses and all the king\'s men couldn\'t put Humpty together again." \nSo it could just be a gruesome story about how a guy fell off a wall, broke \nhis skull, and the king ordered his men to try to put his head back \ntogether.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p216
aS'We need simple algebrian to figure out how he figured that out.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p217
aS'Lol that was hilarious \xef\xbb\xbf'
p218
aS'Chicken or the egg full thing:\nIn order to answer the most famous question of all time: what came first, \nthe chicken or the egg, we\'re gonna need to use the most famous equation of \nall time: e=mc\xc2\xb2. In school, they teach you that Einstien meant that e=mc\xc2\xb2 \nis energy = mass x speed of light squared, but that\'s completely wrong in \nAlgebRyan. What it really means is egg = matter x chicken, little floating \nnumber two. And in order to find out what came first, we have to figure out \nthe matter at hand, which is m. We have to figure out what m equals by \ngetting m by itself. This is where basic AlgeBryan comes in. If you take \nthe square root of both sides, the square root gets rid of the little \nfloating number two, leaving you with: the square root of e = m times c. \nNow to get rid of c, you divide the chicken by both sides, leaving you \nwith: the square root of e over c = m. This may look even more complicated \nand confusing, but bear with me. The little floating number two and the c \nthat we got rid of earlier will help you understand. See if we were to \nwrite this out, it would look like: chicken, little floating number two. \nNotice anything familiar? Exactly. *Chicken Little*. From the nursery \nrhyme. Nursery rhymes were trying to tell us the whole time! Chicken Little \nwas the one who said the sky is falling, and falling is the opposite of \nfloating. So if we take the opposite of "Chicken Little Floating," we get \n"Egg Big Falling." Big Egg Falling! What big egg is most famous for \nfalling? Yet another nursery rhyme. Humpty Dumpty. The same Humpty Dumpty \nthat was on a wall and had a great fall. Get it? On a *wall*, *great* fall? \nHe was on the Great Wall, the Great Wall of China, which mean Humpty Dumpty \nwas *Chinese*. In fact, his name wasn\'t even Humpty Dumpty, it was just *Hu*, \nbut they added the "mpty Dumpty" to make it more pleasant for kids, I \nguess. But Hu was indeed a Chinese egg, which means he came from a Chinese \nchicken, which explains why chickens go "Bok bok bok." They\'re trying to \nsay "bok" as in "Bok-choy" like a Chinese cabbage! And since eggs are the \nopposite of a chicken in this equation, the egg\'s name was Hu, and the \nopposite of that is *Uh*, and that was the name of the Chinese chicken: Uh. \nUh, the Chinese chicken gave us Hu, the Chinese egg, but as you know, as \nmuch as chickens do lay eggs, eggs do hatch into chickens. So Uh doesn\'t \njust give us Hu, Hu gives Uh! Because chickens and eggs are one. But don\'t \nforget, we still have the number two. One, two. Twelve. See, if we go back \nto our original equation, the square root of e over c is just 12, because \nthe square root of an egg (where eggs come from), is a chicken. And if \nyou\'re left with a chicken over a chicken, that\'s two chickens that become \none. One, two. *Twelve*. And we all know that in egg terms, twelve eggs is \na dozen. A dozen = matter. So if you really wanna know the truth, and put \nan end to the most famous question of all time, all you need is basic \nAlgebRyan, and the answer is simple.\n*It dozen matter, Hu gives Uh shit.*\xef\xbb\xbf'

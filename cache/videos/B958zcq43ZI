aS'Small note on the "outsmarting the teacher" part. A lot of the time if \nyou\'re cheating but not being too obvious about it your teacher probably \nsees you cheating, but is letting it slide. Not all the time, but \nespecially for tests that aren\'t that important it happens. We really don\'t \nfind any enjoyment in disrupting everyone\'s test time because of a \ndishonest student if we can help it. (Every teacher is different though)\n\n It\'s like when I used to work at a buffet on my university campus. You \ncan\'t take food home from a buffet, that\'s standard. We had a rule though \nwhere students were allowed to take one piece of fruit or one cookie \nhome/to their dorm if they wanted to.  Some people would take several \nthings, as long as they weren\'t being obvious about it we didn\'t care. But \nif you\'re just blatantly taking 5+ apples, we are obligated to stop you.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p215
aS"just realized he wore smosh's t shirt\xef\xbb\xbf"
p216
aS'No, cheaters don\'t only cheat themselves and don\'t deserve good grades \n"because they outsmarted the teacher". School is about learning, not a \nvideo game where you can find cheats in a magazine. Cheaters cheat more \ndeserving people out of top spots, scholarships, jobs and other \nopportunities. And then they cheat the people who hire them, and the \nclients and patients and world that they were hired to help.\n\nWhen you grow up and you are victimized by a cheater (a cop who cheated on \nthis exams and didn\'t know the law he just abused you with) or a repairman \nwho thinks cutting corners as long as you don\'t know and can\'t see his \nmistake he plastered behind a wall (to break and cause damage in a year) or \na doctor who cheated and misdiagnoses you.... then you will understand.\n\nIn the Ukraine, cheating and bribing teachers through school is a way of \nlife. they DO have a "It\'s smart to cheat" attitude because the \nnon-cheaters and non-bribers don\'t make it through school that well. But \nthey ALSO do not have a good health care system or legal system because \nthose cheaters (incompetent people) occupy those jobs. To get good \nemergency healthcare is a crapshoot over there. People in Ukraine have to \nleave the country to get decent health care.\n\nTHAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING (not yelling, just emphasizing).\n\nCheaters suck. They are the weak links and are a cancer to a great society.\nCheaters are not smart, they are INCOMPETENT (again, not yelling).\n\nThere is no joke here. I see below "It\'s just a joke" when it\'s not. People \ntake stuff like this as jokes and then it seeps into the collective psyche. \nI work with college students and cheating has become a RAMPANT problem. And \nyou can tell because in society, people are getting WORSE at their jobs. \nEgos are soaring but competence level is dwindling.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"i like this video but i think that those people who invented stuff didn't \ndo it just by being lazy. Laziness is probably a strong 'motivation' (lazy \npeople always want to do something more efficiently and with as less effort \nas possible) but if they were lazy and cheated at school, they wouldn't \nunderstand electronics and what things would conduct electricity or what an \nelectric circuit even is, leading them to either make a faulty invention or \nblow themselves up while playing with wires which they knew nothing about. \nFurthermore, the inventions themselves must have required a lot of time and \neffort, which is the direct opposite of being lazy. ('Lazy' means unwilling \nto work or use energy) So though the inventions were admittedly great and \nhelped themselves and everyone else to be more efficient and 'lazy', the \ninventors themselves can't exactly be called 'lazy'. Taking all this into \naccount, being lazy doesn't exactly make you smarter. A lazy person would \nprobably just lay around in bed all day and do nothing. That means he won't \nbe inventing any lightbulbs or airplanes or playing basketball or finding a \ngirlfriend. lol. well, despite all that, i still loved the video!\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'A serious inventor is everything but a lazy person who cheated at school. \nVery much like the opposite. The way I see it is that laziness is causing \npeople using way too much their cars and all the machines that use energy \nin general, therefore polluting and causing global warming with CO2 \nemissions. Lazy people are also often not educated enough to understand the \nreal problems we all causing to the world, with our laziness. Cheating, at \nschool or in a working environment, is causing even more problems: very \ndisrespectful for the people who do no cheat, gradually destroying a \nhealthy merit system. Well, this is becoming too long... I am too lazy to \nfinish it... :)\xef\xbb\xbf'

S"1:15, didn't do anything? Wrong, you smoked marijuana, which was illegal\xef\xbb\xbf"
p10
aS'LEGALIZE WEED!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p11
aS"You are what's wrong with this world, who the fuck reports people for \nsmoking weed\xef\xbb\xbf"
p12
aS"All drugs, even meth, should be legal. Educate people, don't imprison them. \nThe government doesn't even have the right to federally regulate drugs. \nAside from that, drugs and guns don't kill people or commit crimes. That \nwould be people. Arrest people for things like public intoxication, which \nis illegal, poor driving, assault, theft, etc. Don't arrest them for \nwanting to put stuff into their body. Hilarious video, BTW. Loved the part \nwith the drunk guys in the back.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p13
aS"Marijuana isn't better than any other drugs out there. Marijuana kills \nbrain cells, reduces reaction time and IQ which is obviously bad and has \nmore of a physical effect rather than cigerrates. Every drug is different, \nso things like cigerrates or alcohol is not any better. Drugs period are \nstupid, if they want to keep marijuana illegal it'd only air to make every \nother drug illegal. That or legalize them all. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p14
aS'This vid is putting down all the true stoners like myself. I dont listen to \nany of the music named and actually find this vid offensive to a civilized \nperson like myself. Yes you have the dick heads who abuse cannabis but not \na users do so putting all cannabis users down is straight up wrong\xef\xbb\xbf'
p15
aS"Considering the amount of morons protesting the use of marijuana in the \ncomments.. I'm a little on the fence (there really should be something like \nitalics specifically used for sarcasm in text). Pot should be legal... and \ntaxed.. and regulated.. Just like any other substance we put into our \nbodies.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p16
aS"Stoners live stoners die fuck the world lets get high its a plant it grows \nin the ground if god didn't like it, it wouldn't be around so drink 101 and \nsmoke a bowl so party hard and rock n roll to all you preps who think your \ncool fuck you bitches STONERS RULE!!!!!!!!!!!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p17
aS'Lol read the description \xef\xbb\xbf'
p18
aS"the reason the most governments don't allow you tube marijuana like you \nwould tobacco or alcohol is because it would slow down society. Think about \nit. Imagine walking outside and seeing people utterly stoned on the \nstreets, making teenagers more eager to do it, everyone else is, right? And \nmarijuana is pretty much safe for over 21s but it can cause Schizophrenia \nin under 18s very easily  \xef\xbb\xbf"
p19
aS"Honestly speaking, weed is less harmful for people than tobacco. Many \npeople have died, received permanent damaged, or gain diseases. While weed \nmainly causes paranoia. I dont know what the damage is if u smoke it \nconstantly, so I'm not saying that it's a completely safe drug. But it has \nbeen used as medicine (effective medicine), so I really don't understand \nwhy tobacco is legal since it has done damage for so many centuries. \nBut even if it was offered to me, I wouldnt smoke it, though. Never done \ndrugs and never will (lest my parents beat me for the rest of my life). \xef\xbb\xbf"
p20
aS"My brother was killed in 1998 by a pothead who shot him for his money.  He \nwas tied to the crime when he took the money to buy marijuana from \nundercover cops that found the gun that killed my brother.  \nSince then, I have alerted police to probably 20-30 arrests and I'm proud \nto do my part.  Illegal + Ignorance = YOU GO TO JAIL.\n\nAnd no, I don't care if your family depends on you to support them.  You \nsmoke marijuana, you go to jail because you chose drugs over your family. \n SMOKE THAT!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p21
aS'I smoke pot, does that make me a pot head?\xef\xbb\xbf'

p56
aS'Realy? So i am assuming the same applies to alcohol and ciggarettes, as it \nis proven that marujana causes less damage than alcohol, and takes a lot \nmore to become an overdose, also it causes you to get high, a lot less \nlikely to go violent unlike when people go drinking, and everyonehas there \nown way of being happy, its okay they are not doing anything immoral'

aS"My favorite color is green... so I'm a pothead? \xef\xbb\xbf"
p62
aS"Why do you argue about this? If you don't smoke it then stay away from \nvideos and treads talking about it! And if you do smoke it then keep it to \nyourself. I smoke pot but I don't talk about it with my friends that aren't \ninvolved in it, I keep to myself when I smoke or with my friends that do \nsmoke and when we do it we are inside so why do you people care if we so \ncalled ''Potheads'' do smoke it? If we get arrested and get a fine then \nthat is our problem not yours! And just because you smoke pot doesn't mean \nthat you smoke it all the time! If it were legal society wouldn't change! \nAlcohol is legal but everybody isn't drunk all the time, the ones that are \nhave problems and needs help. And if it were legal it would save the \ngovernment money to invest in to more rehabs so people can get rid of their \naddiction to heavier drugs or to alcohol. This is just my opinion everybody \nis entitled to their own opinion so don't flame and cry about this comment. \nPease!\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"I'm the only one who read potterhead instead of pothead? And now is \nwatching a video about drugs?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p143
aS'Not that I am a pot head, most of my friends do smoke. Yes it smells bad \nand is nauseating to be around, but they are my friends who are actually \nsmarter than me. The only reason people look down on it is because it is \nmostly lazy people that use it and give it a bad name. If they want a \ngetaway, let them have. I go home everyday, with my sweater carrying the \nscent of weed, and it does make me sick. I wash it everyday for that, but \nif anything, weed is not a problem for people if they know when to use it. \nPeople who get addicted to it normally have problems. My friends have a \nhard time about it at school, but they are at the top of their class. No, I \ndo not promote it in any way, but I do not think it should be illegal the \nthe extent that gets them into trouble. Tolerating it may not seem \nreasonable, but it is. I was talking to my friend Nick one day, and I told \nhim about my friends and how they smoke. He said,"Well, then they are not \nyour friends." They are humans with outstanding morals and expectations. \nThe smartest people I know to listen to. Now some of them may demonstrate \nthe people in the video, and I do not think they should be using it, but it \nis their choice, so let them be.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'First off, the fact that so many "potheads" got so angry at this video \nshows their stupidity, they are the epitome of an imbecilic \npothead.Secondly, just because something is grown from the ground does NOT \nmean its good for you, nor healthy for you, most of all, does not mean we \nshould be SMOKING it, poison ivy comes from the ground, but you don\'t wipe \nyour ass with it do you? Theres also an immense amount of extremely \npoisonous plants/mushrooms, etc, some that actually don\'t even have a CURE \nYET. So some PLANTS are some of the most harmful things to humans on the \nearth, so harmful that there isn\'t even a cure yet, so if you eat it, you \nare dead.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Until I found out I have epilepsy I had no meds except for pot. \nIt was the only thing that helped. Alcohol made it worse, but since it's \nlegal and all, some people think it's ok to do and look down on people that \nsmoke pot. That's really pathetic, legal or not."

I\'ve never seen a study that says weed \nkills brain cells. But I\'ve never cared to check :P'

The term was shorthand for the time of day the \ngroup would meet, at the campus statue of Louis Pasteur, to smoke pot. \nIntent on developing their own discreet language, they made 420 code for a \ntime to get high, and its use spread among members of an entire generation. \n(Urban Dictionary)'

You can make drugs that aren\'t natural, but most \nhistorically have been and still are harvested from plants. I don\'t get why \npeople seem to think that "natural" is always better/okay. This is not to \nsay that weed/potheads are bad (I wouldn\'t know), but you can\'t just sit \nthere and pretend that a word means something that it doesn\'t.'

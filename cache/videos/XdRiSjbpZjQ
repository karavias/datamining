aS"CREDITS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO LAZY TO PAUSE AND READ IT:\n\nNobody is going to be reading this but I'm going to be writing a bunch of \nstuff anyway. To the person who is reading this, I give you props. I \nwouldn't have spent the time to read this. In fact, all of this probably \ndoesn't make sense because we're currently editing at like 4:15 am and \nwe're exhausted. ANYWAY I just wanted to say that because you read this, \nyou are now better than the other %99\nof the people who didn't read this. I don't know what exactly makes you \nbetter, but you are. AND know that your heart and in your mind and in your \nheart, you and only you can prevent forest fires. Come to think of it...If \nsomkey the bear approached me in the middle of a forest and told me not to \nplay with fire, I'd be so scared that he was talking, that I'd probably try \nto light that bastard on fire.\n\nThe rest of the credits is up to you.

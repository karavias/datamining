p59
aS"Don't make fun of Gaga\xef\xbb\xbf"
p60
aS"I love your videos but I just gotta say you just don't understand that \nstyle of music. It probably wasn't meant for you anyways.\nPop music and edm is meant for dancing and usually the people making (edm \nespecially) that music are focused on the music not the lyrics. Because \nthat's what they make. Its kinda like a guitarist who doesn't sing they are \nmusicians just like any other musician else but they make the music they \nlike. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is don't hate on something just because you don't \nunderstand it. As a lover of dance music I feel the need to stand up for \nit.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p68
aS"Idk why, but i just randomly clicked on his myspace link...just surprised \nit's there\xef\xbb\xbf"
p69
aS"And that's when I realized, that the greatest rapper of all time... was Dr. \nSeuss XD\xef\xbb\xbf"
p70
aS'Rap Music! The sound of the times. You sorta talk lyrics to rhythm and \nrhyme, then deliver, in various ways, some sort of preach and some sort of \npraise. Nevertheless, there\'s a common ground (words), you know that funky \nhiphop sound, Hyped-up bass with a tiny snare, the subwoofer makes your \nneighbor stare. \nYou know, I love rap music, I always have and I always will! \nThere ain\'t no other kind, of music in the world, that makes me feel quite \nas chill! \nI love rap music, you know it\'s sitting at the top of my list, \nSo if you wanna hang with me, then you\'d better believe, we\'ll be jamming \nto a hiphop mix! \nHowever, I agree, there are a lot of lame "musicians" out there. \xef\xbb\xbf'

p93
aS"I know and understand Sean Paul!! he's Jamaican, so i think only people \nfrom the Caribbean would really be able to understand the dialect.. I'm not \nJamaican, I'm from Trinidad, but all the dialects of the Caribbean are \npretty much kinda similar."
p94
aS"T_T you are very in-denial and an idiot (sorry, kinda) for not liking \njapanese music. i don't understand the words either, but i love it anyway. "

aS'music is repetitive because humans love repetition and it gets the artist \nmore views and downloads if i made a song just talking about how my day was \nyea you would listen to the song a couple times but its not catchy u \ncouldn\'t dance to it...that\'s why "popopopo poker face" is catchy and makes \nu wanting more with out even knowing it...my point is that music is this \nway because people love repetition...'
p431
aS'its only pop that does that if you listen to metal lyrics they have meaning \n(metallica specifically)'

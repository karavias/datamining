S"Heres the bottom line.\n\nHumans suck. And we are all vain, stuck-up and arrogant.  And to think that \none gender is better than the other is pretty sexist. Can't we all agree \nthat the world and humans in particular are assholes and move on in life?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p10
aS"The only reason girls care about their looks, is because they'll be made \nfun of if they don't. Because a lot of them can't go out without make-up, \nwithout feeling insecure. \nI don't think you should blame us, for something like that.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p11
aS"We only wear makeup because were insecure. We think we'll be made fun of, \nhurt. Girls are more self conscious.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p12
aS'No gender is better than the other because we all have our pros and cons .\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS"Guys\nPros: we don't give 2 shits about insults or complain\nCons:we can be real douches and fags\n\nGals\nPros: value the relationship\nCons:some are real sluts/bitches\xef\xbb\xbf"
p14
aS"girls wear make up because guys will call them ugly or make fun of them \nbehind their back if they don't. So who's more shallow about looks again?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p15
aS'I\'m just saying but why is it "OK" for a girl to hit a boy but its like \nalmost "illegal" for boy to hit a girl just want to ask?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p16
aS"Im a girl, but I agree with al of ryan's points.... (except with the makeup \nthing) bc I don't wear makeup but, I feel like guys are more easy-going or \njust easy and uncomplicated in general... do u agree? If not tell me what \nyou don't agree with.... don't just rage like an ignorant 7 year old\xef\xbb\xbf"
p17
aS"One reason girls care about looks so much is because they're treated \ndifferently if they look bad. Looks I think is a dealbreaker for guys, and \nit is so deeply ingrained into our culture that ugly and fat people are \nautomatically lower than beautiful people. Even fairy tales tell us this \nfrom a young age.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p18
aS'girls wear makeup and dress well for themselves and not anyone else\xef\xbb\xbf'
p19
aS'0:02 was that riu from street fighter fighting thor?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p20
aS"Ok, it's just for fun but did you know that a hit in the testicles is \nequivalent to 9000 in the pain scale and is equal to 160 births and break \n3200 bones at the same time? Painfull...\nGood video \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xef\xbb\xbf"
p21
aS"I think its stupid that girls spend all their time putting makeup on and \nstuff and they don't realize they are setting themselves up to attract \nshallow guys.\nThe first thing you notice about someone is their appearance. I'm not \nsaying you should wake up in the morning (lookin like p diddy :3) and not \ndo anything but go outside. Im saying you shouldn't spin so much time on \nmakeup. You could be the prettiest girl in the world and have a terrible \npersonality.  Sure, a guy would come talk to you but they wouldn't stay.\n\nActually, If your looking to hook up with strangers i suggest something \nelse. Maybe a dating website or something where you already know \ninformation about them.\n\nYou shouldn't be conceited and put on pounds of makeup just to get \ncompliments from guys. A guy should get to see the real you.  Your \ncharacter is whats important. not your Appearance.\n\nIm gonna close this by repeating im not saying DONT WEAR MAKEUP!\nbecause lets face it you ladies would look like jabba the hutt without \nmakeup\nBut wear it because it makes YOU feel comfortable. dont wear it because of \nother people.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p22
aS"What are Hot Pockets? I don't think we have them in Australia\xef\xbb\xbf"
p23
aS'i dont give a sh*t what i look like :P im a tomboy\xef\xbb\xbf'
p24
aS'Boys dont care too much about their look. Girls put makeup on because they \nexpect people to call them pretty.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p25
aS'The only reason guys seem less caring is because illuminati.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p26
aS"For all you girls out there thinking they would find a guy that cares about \npersonality good luck. Your going to need it. If a guy can't call you \npretty without lying to you he isn't going to date you. Or screw you (If \nyour that old). No guy, and I mean no guy, would date a girl they couldn't \ncall pretty.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p27
aS'I act like both guys and girls xD I also hate going to the mall and calling \nme fat doesnt hurt me that much im like "pff who gives a shift about it \nanyway?"\xef\xbb\xbf'
p28
aS'For girls:\nNot every man is a pervy shallow guy that only cares about your looks. \n\nFor guys: \n\nNot every girl goes around wearing make up (such as me) \n\n\n\nno gender is better then another. Both genders have some problem but you \nall act like there are nothing wrong with females or males. You guys need \nto grow up and learn nobody is better then another. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p29
aS'I hate make up.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p30
aS'Lol, girls be like "OMG, HE TEXT-BROKE UP WITH ME!" and guys be like "DAMN, \nSHE FRIEND-ZONED ME." Being friend-zoned is THE WORST, so much worse than \ntext break ups.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p31
aS'Ugh the misogyny and sexism in the comment section is unbelievable. Maybe \nwe are all equal, ever think of that?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p32
aS'+Avneet Kayla Right. Which is why if an \'attractive,\' guy looks at a girl \nin a low cut shirt, they\'ll let it go and sometimes enjoy it. However, if \nan \'unattractive\' guy looks at the same girl in the same low cut shirt, \nthey\'re often considered to be "pigs" and "perverts." Sounds like the girl \nis being shallow and fishing for selective attention, to me.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p33
aS"Alot of people in the comment section are debating about which gender is \nbetter. Well guess what: NEITHER. We all have our own pros and cons, our \nown personalities, our own everything. That makes everyone equally special \nand different. Sure, lots of girls like pink, and for weird reasons I don't \nknow, but everyone has their own likes and dislikes. \n\nI honestly don't know what's up with this pink craze, but I'm a tomboy, \nso..\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"don't forget guys like to flex a lot too!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p41
aS'I may be a guy but I honestly think that guys are less shallow. (not saying \nthat cause im a guy) Cause we have to be more careful with our actions like \neveryone says "you cant hit a girl" yet a girl walks up to a guy and kicks \nhis balls and 0 fucks are given. And as it says in the video if you call a \ngirl fat she will become depressed. A girl calls a guy fat and they don\'t \ngive a shit.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'They should be in a movie, this was pure gold\xef\xbb\xbf'
p45
aS'Shit shit shit shit shit\xef\xbb\xbf'
p46
aS'Actually, girls care more about their looks because guys care about how \ngirls look like, and girls nowadays are so obsessed with having a \nrelationship so they try to look all nice and pretty every single day.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p47
aS'Has anyone ever noticed that usually in media if it is boys vs girls it is \neither the girls win or it is a tie\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I ship it so much it hurts.... RYAN X (INSERT NAME HERE) I NEED HER NAME!!! \n#YOUTUBEOTP THIS IS SERIOUSLY SO CUTE\xef\xbb\xbf'
p53
aS'A few things. If you tell a girl she is beautiful she will be like oh \nthanks everytime but if you tell her she is fat even for a joke then her \nreaction would be really stupid! Guys take less time to dress up because \nthe things we wear are always on the top of the stack of clothes\xef\xbb\xbf'
p54
aS"Yeah well a guy has to do ALL the work, a guy ALWAYS has to pay, he has to \nbe WAY more careful about what he says/does. For example: If a girl hits a \nguy, she's brave. But if a guy hits a girl, he's a sexist, evil pig. Also, \ngirls need to take things lighter and quit being so concerned about looks. \nSo yeah, guys definitely are in the right here.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p55
aS'Guy at school:"Hey can I have a hug?" Me:"Uh-okay."*I try to hug him* Guy \nat school:"Woah what are you doing you\'re so weird get away from me! Me:*-*\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I don't wear makeup and I don't love to go shopping...I thought I was a \ngirl but I guess not....\xef\xbb\xbf"
p60
aS"So.. I'm the kind of girl who acts like a guy and uhh... I like playing \nvideo games i hate make-up i love eating food and good thing i dont get fat \nand last.. I DONT F*CKING CARE WHAT THE PEOPLE THING ABOUT ME *eats pizza*\xef\xbb\xbf"
p61
aS'I dont wear make ups....well except for the occassional lipgloss and face \npowder. Anyway, It was just fine and i dont care what others think of me \nwithout it whether girls cringe or guys does not shout dayummmm, the heck i \ncare. Lol\xef\xbb\xbf'
p62
aS"Girls fall in love with what they listen. Boys fall in love with what they \nlook. That's why girls wear make up and boys lie.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p63
aS'Men rule the World!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p64
aS'Just a reminder that being a "tomboy" doesn\'t make you special or superior \nto other girls and it\'s ridiculous to think that acting feminine should be \nfrowned upon. It\'s fine to like things that others normally wouldn\'t but \nusing that to make yourself seem superior isn\'t :D\xef\xbb\xbf'
p65
aS"Girls wear make up because of guys cuz guys only like the hot girls and if \na girl showed up with no make up guys r gonna think that she's ugly or at \nleast less prettier than usuall and do you know why girls get sad when u \nsay thay look fat its becuz guys DO NOT like FAT GIRLS\nand if ur a guy u gotta be at least agree with me 40+%\xef\xbb\xbf"
p66
aS'his is my moms accoun but anyway did she really kissed him xo\xef\xbb\xbf'
p67
aS'A good appearance is not only about how do you look like, but how satisfied \nyou are with the way you look. Also, who is really nice, looks nice without \nmakeup. Those need things like that who are not confident (which is quite \nsad knowing that confidence is one of the most important things). Of \ncourse, if you need makeup to reach it, to feel more comfortable, wear it. \nBut that guy who will love you will love all of you. Because he will not be \nin love with your body but with the person who you really are.\nThey say you can change a lot of things by using makeup. But one thing is \nthat you can change without any helps is your attitude.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p68
aS"Boys don't care much about their looks? What... Is it just me? '-'\xef\xbb\xbf"
p69
aS'Haha, actually the guy reminds me of me (i\'m a girl). Guys are so much \nbetter company than girls, who are bitchy, whiny, and dramatic over \nnothing. Whereas with guys the main topics are fetishes, food, and gaming. \nmuch more interesting. I must admit I love looking nice as much as the next \ngirl though, but it\'s more because i\'m fascinated as how my look can \npsychologically influence even random strangers. A dungaree dress and \nplaits? People let you cross the road, and you\'re more likely to get a seat \non the train/bus. Snapback, ripped jeans and straightened hair? Filthy \nlooks and being spat at in the street, plus the muttered remarks of "slut". \nSame girl, different clothes =p Many interest =p Ironically neither of \nthose looks are naturally what i\'d wear, which is, i\'d quite happily walk \naround in a bikini if the weather permitted it, and the law. But since I \nhave to wear stuff, it may as well be half decent stuff, and aid my \npsychological research. But yeah, rambling there. Girls are much more \nirritating than guys to be friends with. I\'m bisexual, but I wouldn\'t date \na girl because they\'re too much hassle. Attractive as girls are, guys are \njust better for relationships. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p70
aS'why do girls put on make up. It takes up more of your time, you can poke \nyourself with mascara, lipstick has fish scales in it, it may make you look \na little weird. Honestly make up is just stupid. as well as heels\xef\xbb\xbf'
p71
aS"Forgot one thing, if you have money just enough most girls will put that at \nleast in their mind when to choose to say yes to a date. Some girls anyway. \nI never cared about what a girls bank account was. Feel like that's a \ndifference. Wait, do men care how much? Am I different?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p72
aS'Some girls get offended just because they can\xef\xbb\xbf'
p73
aS'So true\xef\xbb\xbf'
p74
aS'Im a guy/girl and im different from everyone else!!1!! Give me \nattention!!!!1!!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p75
aS'The only reason girls go out of their way for looking good is because when \nwe don\'t get stuff done to us guys say ,"why do you look so tired."\xef\xbb\xbf'
p76
aS'Wtf is with getting mugshots Goddamn\n\xef\xbb\xbf'
p77
aS"Actually, this video is based on the male/female brain. While there is the \nassumption that all women are more caring and emotional and all men don't \ncare how they look these traits can apply to the opposite gender as well. \nHaving a female brain just means having those traits not BEING female. The \nsame applies for males. I personally have more of a female brain and I am a \nguy so these arguments are a little silly \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Y ARE WE ALL BEING SO DEEP QBOUT THIS?!!! ITS SUPPOSE TO BE A HAPPY GUNNY \nVIDEO NOT A FREAKING TEAR SHOW!! Seriously tho if you have a point don't \nsay it so deeply just say- \nWell actually think girls win because... \nNot-\nGuys it's so unfair that you think guys are better than girls...\nSERIOUSLY PEOPLE SUCK IT UP!!!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p82
aS"Don't try to understand a woman...\nWoman understand woman and they hate each other, lol\xef\xbb\xbf"
p83
aS"Well Ryan that's bullshit\xef\xbb\xbf"
p84
aS'Okay, i have no idea whats up with the BIG commotion...everyone is like \n"its only abt the inner beauty that matters, not the looks" or just \noffending the other gender unknowingly.Humans are equal.Each of us have our \nown imperfections and good side.And ppl who say looks dont matter.ur partly \nwrong.what is the first thing u see in a person.Appearance.U find them \npretty u immediately tryy to go make friends with them(but smtmes end up \nalone). And then when u see a fat girl u start making fun of her or talk \nbehind her back, at least the first time.Then aft u get to know her u find \nshes nice and yeah...so ppl!Stop this ish and move on with ur lives!This is \njust a comedy video!Gawd! -.-\xef\xbb\xbf'

p107
aS"To be truthful here, I'm a girl and I for one look absolutely horrible in \nmake up. I mean, even the best make up artists can't make me look prettier \nin make up but it instead does the opposite. I mean, I'm not saying I'm \ngorgeous or anything. Plus, I hate makeup. It just.... Make up, it is like \ncake on your face and it itches terribly. And when I tried on the eyeliner, \nI tell you, my eyeballs keep getting poked and its a miracle that my eye \nhasn't been blinded yet. I rather see girls go out natural even though, \nyeah, some girls do look prettier with make up, just, i don't like seeing \ngirls with TOO much make up. You know? It makes girls look fake and I \nforone, wqs nevwrthose kinda of girls who play with make up and dolls. I \nmean, i do play wih dolls by giving them haircuts, like bald haircuts.... \nO.o No wait. Nevermind, ignore that. Just simply to put it,everyone has \ntheir own opinion on make up because some feel more confident in makeup, \nsome don't like makeup, some put too much make up, some don't put on makeup \nor simply because makeup is irritating on the face. Like me. So for me, \nmake up is.... TERRIBLE. My experiences with makeup was never good. XD \nWell, that is my opinion. \xef\xbb\xbf"

p110
aS"Why does this video need to exist? Why can't people just accept that people \nare generally going to do whatever they do as an individual? It's not about \ngender. I know plenty of guys who are just as sensitive as the stereotype \nregarding girls. I myself tend not to give much of a shit when a guy breaks \nup with me. I mean, not every relationship is going to work, so I feel \nthere's no point to crying and stuffing my face and being a bitch about it. \nDoesn't mean I don't comfort my guy friends after their relationships end \non a bad note, but it's never been a big deal to me. It's more about who \nyou are as a person than what your gender is.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p111
aS"Often, guys notice things, like a haircut or painted nails, but they don't \ncare. It doesn't make you any more or less attractive.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p112
aS'Lol my girlfriend broke up with me and it definitely hit me harder. She was \nnot even carrying how fuc*ing down i was. She was happy after she broke up \nwith me and right after she broke up with me, she was walking to her \nfriends and telling them that she dumped me (in a pretty happy voice, even \ni could hear it). And two weeks after, she has another boyfriend, and even \nworse that was one of my bestfriends. But i actually dont give a shit now \nbecause one of my friends told me that she was an asshole to all of her \nboyfriends:P \n\n/sarcasm activated Yes girls are ALOT more sensitive\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82\n\nYeah.

p113
aS'Both good points!!! What do you think?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p114
aS'You know who mostly calls girls ugly? Other girls. If you feel insecure \nabout appearances, then you feel insecure about shallow things. Plain and \nsimple. Guys are shallow as well, though. Not all guys, but some.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I know girls can have a choice to not wear makeup and not give a crap about \nhow they look but girls wear makeup and dress nice so that they can make \nTHEMSELVES. They dont always dress up and wear makeup to impress someone \nthey dont dress to impress you! if they want to wear it because THEY like \nit on THEMSELVES then let them. Ya i know that boys can have it hard too, \nbut just remember women were the ones who got you here and they busyed \ntheir asses had to go through pain to get you here on this planet. Some \nboys only care about how a girl looks and just want to get into their pants \nthen leave. Then they go and tell their frieinds then THE GIRLS get called \nsluts,whores. If guys would just look past how girls looka dn really get to \nknow them, then girls can really feel better instead of being called ugly \nor a slut everyday. I think we get enough shit as it is. And we have to \ndeal with peroods, and everytime we get mad, a boys first thing they think \nis oh shes on her period then they say out loud now how does that make a \ngirl feel? MAYBE THATS WHY THEY GET MAD.. Its shit guys say that make them \nmad dont get me wrong girls say shit too but in my experiences its mostly \nguys. Girls at my school are there for one another when a guy says \nsomething, some guys arent. A girl was told to shutup in my class and a \ngirl walked over to the guy and siad "dont tell her to shutup, she did \nnothing to you" and sat back down. I understand boys have it hard too but \ngirls have it harder. Try being a girl for a day and then youd be quite. \nThe list can go on and on why girls have it harder this is just the tip of \nthe iceburg. \xef\xbb\xbf'

Make-up just hides who you really are, and men sometimes \ncare way more than the girl.\nEither cause the girl is defending her self from an inevitable break-up, or \na guy is just a total douche.\n\nThere for\nWoman 50%\nMen 50%\xef\xbb\xbf'

All anyone really want \nis someone to talk to, but people are too selfish and conceited to the \npoint that some people are just to afraid to show who they really are. They \nare scared to be insulted, which people carry insults to everyone aka \nracism is worse. People stretch out their eyes to make it smaller is plain \nrude, just because I am asian doesn't automatically make me have small eyes \nor make me have and asian accent or to speak or be Chinese. At my school, \nso many people bring up racist jokes like it is nothing or insult anyone to \nmake others laugh. I hate when I see someone who is not even trying to be \nnice to one another and is just faking it. If you'd try to do this, it is \nreally noticeable.

aS'I often enjoy your video but not this one. This is one is sexist Ryan, and \nit\'s not funny, it\'s harmful. First of all, girls care about their \nappearance because society tell them that it decides their worth. No makeup \nmeans that she doesn\'t care about herself, look like a dude, loser, or just \nplain ugly. But makeup means she\'s shallow, trying to get attention. How \nfair is that? Second of all, friendzone. If a girls say yes, she\'s easy. If \nshe say no, friendzoned. You guys just leave women no choice. Third of all, \nmen care less in a relationship because society associates emotions with \nweakness and shame them for being sad. There\'s no guys vs girls and stuff \nlike that, boys and girls can be shallow, can be hurtful, we can get dumped \nor dump others. Just because you\'ve been hurt by girls before doesn\'t mean \nyou have to say "All girls are the same". Or vice versa. Even as a joke, \nthis perpetuates the gender stereotype and promote sexism that oppress both \nwomen and men. Please don\'t do stuff like this anymore.\xef\xbb\xbf'

To those people who said guys are better than girls because girls \nonly care about their appearance, many you should compliment females more \noften whether they wear makeup or not, and see if you care about looks as \nmuch as you say females do. Could you walk up to someone who was "fat" (I \nuse the term \'fat\' loosely here because usually society\'s view on \'fat\' is \nnot actually fat), ratty brunette hair, and was wearing clothes way too \ntight and provocative, that she was still beautiful?

I will admit i do fix my hair, but thats a personal \npreference, its normally all in my face, thick, and frizzy and \nstraightening fixes that, so I do it, simple.

aS'Yeah, I would\'ve loved this video, Ryan, but not EVERY girl cares about \ntheir looks. I hardly doubt many females in 3rd world counties care about \ntheir eye shadow. Also, it\'s not like there aren\'t things that are designed \nto lower our self-esteem. Take a look at commercials designed for women \nversus men: http://imgur.com/gallery/pWfwq Commercials target our \nweaknesses and take advantage of them so we buy their product. Commercials \nthat target men simply attempt to boost their ego\'s.\n\nAlso, guys, whenever you\'re in a clothing store that sells both guys and \ngirls clothing, take a minute to browse the female clothing. Notice how \npaper fucking thin and/or unconventional our clothing choices are. I\'ve \nliterally spent months now trying to find a long-sleeved shirt that is \nactually warm and the neckline doesn\'t end right at my nipples. So, you \nmight want to rethink before you tell a girl she should have thought about \ndressing warm. Oh, and not to mention the "we don\'t have fucking pockets \nthat can actually hold the shit we need to hold". Seriously. Take a look at \nour pants/jeans choices. I have to wear formal attire to my college \neveryday and no matter where I shop, thrift stores, high-end places, all \ntheir formal pants NEVER have any fucking pockets because "it doesn\'t look \nas nice". Fuck that. I don\'t fucking care about if it looks nice or not. I \nwant to be able to fit my fucking wallet some place when I go get lunch.\n\n"Why don\'t you try male clothing?" I have. About 40% of my closet was \ndesigned for males. Also, when you\'re a 21-year-old, 5\'0 female who weighs \nabout 100 pounds, it\'s hard trying to find the male equivalent size of \nshirt that doesn\'t have huge shoulders space or go past my knees.\n\nSo, yeah, there\'s that.\xef\xbb\xbf'

I got dumped \nlike 2 months ago by a girl who I was totally in love with, and who I did \neverything right with. And now she doesn't even care while I'm still \nstruggling to come to terms with it. So no, girls arent more invested in \nrelationships then guys, although nor are guys more invested\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Dear Ayy,\nDisabling replies to your comments *IS* being childish.\nWhen you post on a public "forum" on matters like Girl Vs Boys, or in this \ncase, racism against whites not happening, you had better be ready to deal \nwith a lengthy discussion on the matter, freedom of speech is not one way.\n \nNow, since you just had to be childish and plug your ears going "lalalalala \nI can\'t hear you", I can only reply to you like this.\n \nCorrection, you gave a *SINGLE* link that has multiple links. You did not \nactually give multiple links. ;)\n \nEhm:\nRacist:\n"a person who believes that a particular race is superior to another."\nOR\n"Having or showing the belief that a particular race is superior to \nanother."\nThe actual definition of a racist.\nThis means that black slaves where taught to be racist, because they were \ntaught that White people where superior, and of course some ended up \nthinking this and became racist toward white people, and of course some \nblack people do still think white people are superior, you probably should \ngo study sociology.\nI am not ignorant see? :-)\nWell... at least not on this subject. Lol\nYou should know that racial discrimination *IS A FORM OF RACISM*, and is \nborn from racism. If we had no racism, there would be no racial \ndiscrimination.\nThe  only difference between racism and racial discrimination is that \nracial discrimination is on a smaller scale, but it is still racism because \nin order to racially discriminate, you *must* think that the race your \ndiscriminating against is lesser, and thus you are being racist.\n \nRacism:\n"prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a \ndifferent race based on the belief that one\'s own race is superior."\n \nIts obvious that you have not heard of the term "Black Supremacy" and there \nare such groups, thus there does exist racism against whites.\nAnd, some Islams believe that white people where grafted from blacks, and \nthus are lesser, so it is not simply a matter of "African American vs White \npeople".\n \nJudging racism against whites only in terms of it happening amongst African \nAmericans is close minded and promotes ignorance.\n \nNow, since you provided a link to unofficial sources and call it \n"education", and say you provided multiple links, I shall do the same.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_supremacy  \nThere, now your no longer ignorant on this matter! :-) \\0/\nWow... what a change of subject! lol\xef\xbb\xbf'

Also, most western media over \nemphasises the importance of conforming to the status quo and the \nstereotypes, which can mean different things for different races, genders, \nsexualities and so on - but it all boils down to the same thing. To make \nsense of the world and so that people can make sense of us we dress, act \nand often think in a way that fits with a certain 'type' or 'stereotype'. \nSo a guy who wants to be seen as a butch kind of guy will probably work out \nto grow his muscles and still drink bucket loads of beer and eat lots of \nunhealthy food (no criticism just a loose example), so arguably this is \nsometimes more 'image crafting' and less 'caring about physical wellbeing'. \nPerhaps a girl who doesn't want to be seen as ditsy or a sheep will choose \nnot to wear makeup. That doesn't mean she isn't a sheep or ditsy, and \nwearing makeup doesn't mean anything either. However, everyone knows that \nhow they choose to act and dress absolutely affects the impression they \nmake, so in general people dress so they can categorise themselves \nappropriately to who they want to spend their time with, where they want to \nwork, or just what makes them feel powerful. I certainly don't think there \nis anything wrong with conforming or individuality, as each has its place \nin a healthy and happy lifestyle. What do y'all think?\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Dear people of the interwebz,\n \n  Can everyone please calm down? The point is that it doesn't matter if \nyou're male, female, transgender-we're all human. We can all be shallow, we \ncan all be uncaring. It's not a competition to see who is less shallow or \nwho cares more. We're socialized in different ways, and our behaviour is a \nreaffirmation of that. If you are a girl who wears make up, to draw \nattention from boys-that's your choice. If you wear it to make yourself \nfeel good-that's you're choice. If you don't wear make up-good for you. \n   And for Christ's sake, stop seeing the world in black and white. Girls \nand boys are not necessarily a dichotomy. Neither are better than the \nother. \nPeace out. \xef\xbb\xbf"

I hate shopping \nand painting my nails1 girls are just drama and bitches, >< and should be \nmore liek boyz. xDDD my bf and i eat pizza and play Call of Duty together! \nIm different and unique! plz like me :3 \n\n\nAll jokes aside there is nothing wrong with being masculine or feminine. A \ngirl can like boy things and a boy can like girl things. That makes them \nindividuals, but it\'s not revolutionary. It\'s not uncommon at all anymore \nin this day and age.\n\nPeople should simply strive to be better people and not strive for \nperceived traits of the opposite gender. People also shouldn\'t stereotype \ngenders, or idolize one over the other. Men and women can both be assholes \nand terrible friends. They can both be best friends and awesome to be \naround. They can also both be sexist and both be great cooks. The list goes \non. Even if you met 100 women who were bitches or 100 men who were \ndouchebags in your lifetime it doesn\'t make it true for all women and men.\n\nThere are millions of people on this Earth. Generalizing them makes no \nsense. (Like saying every single candy tastes the same). It\'s usually a \nself fulfilling prophecy. Everyone is an asshole if you believe they are, \nand if you see otherwise, your brain pretends it doesn\'t or you \nconveniently "forget". If you assume all women are bitchy or dramatic you \nwill perceive them that way, before they even open their mouth to say \nhello. You\'ve put them in your narrow-minded box before even knowing them \nas a person. Whatever they may do, to you, is seen as bitchy and dramatic, \neven if it isn\'t, thus reaffirming your generalization. Would you like to \npeople to see you as a stuck up bitch or a douchebag and hate you before \nyou\'ve even talked to them? Didn\'t think so. In my opinion, everyone just \nneeds to stop being terrible people, stop generalizing and begin to treat \npeople as respectfully and as individuals, not as a product of their \ngender.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'So, the reason why lots of girls wear makeup is because they are bombarded \nwith subliminal messaging, telling them how they should look. You get lots \nof examples of these in adverts. This pressure is kept up by men who feel \nthat is what a perfect woman should look like. Although the same sort of \nthing happens to men, the pressure is not as great because men haven\'t been \nunder judgement for so long; women (for a VERY long time have) been \nrepressed by society - told what they should wear, how they should act, \nwhat jobs they can do and how much of a disgrace they were if they broke \nthese rules "set in stone" - from as early as the Romans and almost \ndefinitely earlier. \n\nYes, some girls wear makeup for their own enjoyment, and that is totally \nOK, as are men who work out to get a figure they are happy with. People \nchoose their own lifestyles; I am just saying that there is lots of \npressure (more than men feel) on girls to have the perfect looks.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"Men judge by appearence, women judge by appearence, we all do it, even if \nwe don't mean to. And most women wear makeup to make themselves feel good, \nyes they want some one else to notice and say they look nice, but they \ndon't just do it for others, they do it for themselves. And i think this \nall depends on gender. Girls will see their own point of view in this video \nand vice versa for guys. But not all girls and guys are like the people on \nthis video. Everyone is different when it comes to relationships, this is \njust the stereotype.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Mind if I say everyone has a difference in the relationship stereotype, I \nmean from tomboys to hipster dudes people have their strengths and \nweaknesses as individuals and the point of every relationship is to learn \nmore about not simply your other but who you are and what you care about. \nSo yeah...neutral, never been kissed or in a relationship but yeah team \nneutral.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I care about my looks for myself. I've been wearing makeup for a few years \nnow and I do it for myself because I don't feel pretty unless I'm wearing \nmakeup. I buy clothes and makeup to for me and only me. I have a boyfriend \nand I don't change anything about my clothes or makeup for him. He tells me \nI shouldn't wear makeup kus I look good without it but I don't believe him \nkus it's what I think about myself. This rant went on longer than expected. \nWhoops. But anyway I wear makeup and choose my clothes for myself so I can \nfeel kinda pretty. This video is kinda accurate tho for some people I know \ntho. \xef\xbb\xbf"

p649
aS'OMG i know where you were when you were walking outside!!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p650
aS'the reason why girls are so self conscious about the way they look is \nbecause guys are so focused on how girls look, that girls quickly realize \nthat looking good is one of the biggest things that gives a girl any sort \nof power. And it becomes a competition between girls of who looks better, \nbecause the better looking one becomes the one with more power. Brains come \nin only second, the first is always looks. I dare you to prove me wrong. \xef\xbb\xbf'

p665
aS'Dear Ryan how many mints can you put in your mouth at once\n\xef\xbb\xbf'
p666
aS"The reason girls care so much about their looks is because guys wouldn't \neven share a passing glance is the girl wasn't hot or sexy so yes we care \nbecause we don't want to end up alone and don't tell me guys don't spend \nHUNDREDS of dollars on shoes why?

aS"I didn't like how he called women shallow. If we didn't try our hardest to \nlook good men wouldn't find us attractive. Men are usually the reason we \ndress nice and get our hair done and all that good stuff. Men don't usually \ngo for the girls wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and hair not done. \xef\xbb\xbf"

p742
aS"all right, look. Guys aren't perfect and neither are girls. Neither gender \nis better or worse than the other so no one should argue about which is \nbetter. BUT, while we're butthurting it always ticked me off that it's ok \nfor a girl to hit a guy but if a guy hits a girl he gets freakin' arrested. \nGirls are always demanding equality so it should be illegal for a girl to \nhit a guy. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Some boys do care a lot and some girls dont put makeup everyday or get \noffended when they're called fat.\nMe for example: I only use makeup at really important events, because I \nthink real beauty is natural beauty. I honestly prefer an ugly girl that \nlooks fresh and natural without killograms of makeup on her face than a \nfake barbie looking woman!\nAnd I know for a fact that a lot of guys DO care when they really are in \nlove.\n\nBut it's kinda truth that this things are rare, or they wouldnt be \nbeautiful and valeued :)\n\nXoxo love you Ryan with all my lamp heart!\xef\xbb\xbf"

Heck, I don't even care about \nhow I look. And, actually, I think that some time girls can be just as \ninsensitive as guys. I've been told that I can be rather inconsiderate \ntowards others even when I'm joking around or say something meaning it to \nbe a harmless joke. When people call other people fat, I don't see why some \npeople get offended- even when the person, themselves, had called \nthemselves fat just three minutes ago. Take it as a compliment when others \ncall you fat... it's called being FLABULOUS!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p917
aS'guys in general have to do more effort because they have to approach girls \nor seduce them... girls think they can\'t approach guys, but it would be \neasier that way...\ngirls always have more options, and she has to filter, sometimes even \nwithout telling the guy she dumps... but just ignoring him... thinking he \nwill not get hurt that way... in stead of being honest with him...\ntherefore a guy has to have many girls, so that when he loses one, it\'s not \nthe end of the world.. and he wants to become "the man", so that girls will \nfollow him... so guys train and study for this (proof, every dating advice \nhandbook is about how to get girls)\nso when they want to become "hard to get", girls say he\'s shallow and \ndoesn\'t show his emotions, that because he\'s scared of getting hurt, \nbecause guys fall more easily in love than girls, but the girl chooses \neverything, the guy always wants more, because he has that little choice, \nand a girl has more choice, so she waits and finds the best guy... that way \nthe girl always wants the least, and the person in a relationship who wants \nthe least, gets his way, obvious... that way guys maybe also starting to \nhide their emotions... and in the end the girl says that all guys are the \nsame and guys say the same thing about girls... \nI\'m just telling my opinion, because I\'m a guy, but girls will have their \nopinion too,\nit would be more easy when we just talked more and didn\'t play games\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Honestly I think the world would be a better place if girls acted like guys \nlol idek. I mean, guys are less dramatic (i simply can\'t stand drama \nunfortunately im sorry) and they do not make a big fuss over small, lame \nthings. The reason why guys get along better with one another is cause \nwhenever they kind of "insult" one another jokingly, the other party does \nnot take it to heart (most of the time anyway). Instead they just brush it \noff and maybe even "insult" them back. Jokingly and for fun of course. \nWhereas for girls, i feel that they get too sensitive easily, and tend to \nover react more than guys. I seriously just can\'t stand those drama mama \nkind, like dude! you\'re not acting in a drama right now!? \nBut obviously, all the above is just my personal opinion, so please don\'t \nstart debating and what not with me please tyvm.

aS'No lie I was eating a hot pocket during this and I still am. YUMMMMMMMMMM\xef\xbb\xbf'
p965
aS"The reason that both guys and girls act the way they do is because society \nhas molded them as such. In American society, for example, as girls and \nboys reach puberty, they begin to want to become an individual, someone who \nis important. But, the market for clothes, make-up, and even cell phones \nreach these kids at a young age, essentially molding them to become what \nthe current stereotype is today. It was the same exact situation in the \n90's, 80's, and even the 50's.\n\nTeenagers want to fit in, while also holding a sense of self. Kids conform \neasily, and because they are raised that way, they stay that way. The only \nones who don't are nonconformists and the mentally retarded--as in, those \nwith poor communication and social skills. \n\nThis is the truth, no matter what way you look at it. Every society brings \nup its children differently, but no matter where you grow up, adolescents \nwill want attention and a sense of self. As they grow in this environment \n(i.e. wearing something will help you fit in) kids will bring their \nself-esteem to a better level, and keep this mindset all throughout life. \nEspecially in America.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"It's true that girls can be just as shallow as boys are, but just because \ngirls care about their appearance so much-- that doesn't make us more \nshallow than boys. Girls dress up a lot, and yes, we do do a lot of \nshopping and buy a lot of clothes to make us look good, but that's because \nwe want to feel good about ourselves. A lot of girls dress up and wear make \nup for ourselves. We do it to make us feel good and feel happy. We care \nabout our appearance because as much as people try to deny it, appearances \ndo show a lot about a person. Girls don't dress up because of boys and not \nbecause we are shallow, we dress up because we care about ourselves. Let me \nsay that again: we. care. about. ourselves. Everyone should care about \nthemselves, right? Caring for yourself doesn't make you shallow now does \nit? \xef\xbb\xbf"

p1069
aS"Women don't use make-up or fancy clothes/jewelery to ''hide'' their beauty, \nand they don't picture it as objectification, MAKE-UP is an art, DRESSING \nis an art. And something that has been used in every culture and varied for \ncenturies. This ''idea'' that women use it to hide who they really are is \nstereotypical, and is mostly common among teens who haven't found out who \nthey are yet. But an actual woman knows very well that make-up is an art, \nher clothing and dressing is a style. It's an expression, and being \nobjectified for it is absolutely ridiculous. \xef\xbb\xbf"

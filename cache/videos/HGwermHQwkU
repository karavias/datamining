S'After years of purposely stopping myself, I recently got back into gaming.. \nThese are the of the most annoying gamers on the internet (MAGOTI).\xef\xbb\xbf'
p10
aS"Not to mention, as a girl, if you make one tiny mistake, everyone's gonna \nsay you suck cuz you're a girl. They suddenly have higher standards for how \ngood you're supposed to be. At least in my experience. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p11
aS'To the girls on this comment section that play online, you guys complain \nthat guys say ton of things due to your sex. But then you also say that its \na HUGE issue when a guy is trying to be nice to you online. Has it ever \noccurred to you that this person wants to expand the gaming world so that \nmore gamer girls will want to play due to thinking there isn\'t that many \ndueches online? Get over yourselves if you think that way that"oh my god \nBecky he wants to flirt" no just no.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS'Definition of call of duty:\nAnnoying gamers;\nNoob players;\nSqueakers;\nShitty game\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS'Start a flame war. Like, now. In this section.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p14
aS'You know how people think gaming is a waste of time, but is it really \nwasting time if you enjoy it??\xef\xbb\xbf'
p15
aS"So many retards call themselves gamers....Playing games on your phone \ndoesn't make you a gamer.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p16
aS'Everytime I join a server and usually I would be the only girl and they( \nthe boys) would always be so fucking annoying and teasing me. I challenge \nthem to a type of battle and for the majority of the time I kick their \nducking ass :P\xef\xbb\xbf'
p17
aS'Hold up, girls make up like half of the gaming population, maybe even afew \npercent more, you dont really notice them online though cuz they rarely try \nto make it obvious (unless they\'re one of those girls who tries to get \nattention by screaming "GUYS, IM A GURL GAMER!11!!"), so you wont see the \ndifference between a girl and a guy gamer when you cant hear the voice.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p18
aS"Man, I can't fucking stand desperate guys. In fact, I make it a point to \nfreak them out as much as possible. Like:\n\nDesperate Virgin: Oh you're a chick, eh?\nMe: Yerp.\nDesperate Virgin: Well, In that case, you wanna talk on private chat-\nMe: **Lying** I'm a lesbian.\nDesperate Virgin: Oh...\n\nOr sometimes:\n\nDesperate Virgin: Hey, you wanna chat with me? ;)\nMe:**runs up behind him in-game and knifes him in the neck** No bitch.\n\nAnd if I'm on MC:\n\nDesperate Crafter: *starts crouching up and down repeatedly on top of my \ncharacter while I sleep*\nMe: Oh, fucking SERIOUSLY! **pulls out enchanted diamond sword he didn't \nknow I had and slaughters him**\n\nSeriously, dude, if you can't get a REAL girlfriend, having one who you \ncan't even touch and doesn't know you is even MORE pathetic.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p19
aS'Paste whatever you copied! \xef\xbb\xbf'
p20
aS'Also kids who say IMA HACK YU ACCANT BIATCH. Even tho they dont know how to \nhack\xef\xbb\xbf'
p21
aS'Let it take you, my friend. Give in to temptation. Join us.\nJoin us.\n\n\n\n\n\n:3\xef\xbb\xbf'
p22
aS"I'm gona be honest, EVERYONE I met who was an American was an fucking \nasshole.\n1 - 5 out of 1000 Americans I played with was actually okay/cool/alright.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p23
aS'And the battlefield players are the worst. Like omg! \xef\xbb\xbf'
p24
aS'Hey guys my professor in college gave me a very hard Math Question, I need \nyour help what is 9+10?\xef\xbb\xbf'

p27
aS'why is this dude so sexist?? what the hell thats why i dont subscribe to \nthis fucker\xef\xbb\xbf'
p28
aS"5 biggest problems in gaming:\n\n1. Perverts: males are very rude when they meet girl gamers, all they do is \ntalk about sex, call them cute, and males create female nude emblems in a \ngame like Call Of Duty Black Ops1/2\n2.Cheaters: Hackers, Boosters, Xp Lobbies, Glitching, All these diffrent \nthings that people don't care about. Going into a wall so enemies can't \nshoot you, making a second controller and getting XP by killing him, that's \nwhy something called banning started.\n3. Little Kids or what I like to call them, Squeakers: little kids playing \n17+ games not a good idea, over 1,000 kids involve killing someone for the \ncause of M Rated games, little kids even swear and know what something like \nsex is\n4. Lag Switchers: if you ever try to win a game and all of a sudden your \nmultiplayer game lags so much, you freeze and lose, well say hello to \nsomeone who invented the Lag Switch, this creation got over 75,000 player \nbannned the first day it was invented, people sold it for 100$ each, daily \nonly 100 people get banned for lag switching every day.\n5. Afk's: Lets say your playing zombies in Call Of Duty Black Ops 2 and \nyour one round away from beating the world record and winning 1 million \ndollars, then everyone but you becomes Afk!? It has pissed people off in \nlevels that are so high that they break things like controls, windows, and \neven throw there consoles and break them.\n.\nPlease like so everyone can see, it took me 30 minutes to write this.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p29
aS'Actually, according to the internet advertising bureau, it was found that \n52% of gamers are female..\n\nplease stop stereotyping.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p30
aS'Hey everyone! I am a guy gamer. Just needed to point out that I am a guy \ngamer. Thanks guys!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p31
aS"Not to mention, if you have anything in your gamertag identifying you're \nfrom a different ethnicity,  you can always count on an American to be \nracist!! \xef\xbb\xbf"
p32
aS"Ryan Newb is someone who is new to the game :P \nnoob is just someone who has been playing for so long and still stupid.\n\nAnd btw i am a gamer girl and i never say that i am a girl on games because \nyour game will be ruined .. the only disadvantage that you don't get to \ntalk on the mike :( \nIt's really annoying if they know that you are a girl .. i keep my identity \nsecret :P so i might be one of your mates muhaha O.o\nI'm out.. Teehee\xef\xbb\xbf"
p33
aS"I'm a hardcore gamer! i'm the type to get so mad over a loss and make an \nexcuse haha!! But Its really rare for me to lose :D \xef\xbb\xbf"
p34
aS"Such a load of shit. You quit gaming because you know it's a waste of your \nfucking time. Why would you want to play crap video games when you could \nand are being way more productive making money off YouTube and living your \nlife to it's best. Gaming is the most wasteful hobby there is.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p35
aS"y'all act like playing games is a stigma. \ndon't be.\nits a form of media.\n\nYou wouldn't rag on someone reading a book, or someone watching a movie, so \nwhy would you rag on this?\nIt's a form of story telling, and interactive story telling at that, which \nis why its so addicting, because with the interaction you feel like you're \nwhisked away to another world.\n\n...Which is why that games are my FAVORITE type of media.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p36
aS'A noob is when you play a game about 9 months or less or more and your \nstill bad\nA newbie is when your new to the game :)\n\n\n\ncant wait to get hate also im bad at english :)\xef\xbb\xbf'
p37
aS'My friend\'s older brother is a mic abuser. He plays League of Legends and \nhe\'s always shouting into his mic," OH FUCK YOU BRUHHHH!!!!!!!" or "OMG U \nFAGGIT CAN\'T U PLAY RIGHT? FUCKIN NEEEEEEEEEEWB!!!!" \n\nYou can see why whenever I go over to her house I have to bring earplugs. \n\nAnd I believe he is also a "Bossy" guy. I was watching him play League once \nand one guy accidentally did something wrong (I don\'t play League, okay?), \nand then my friend\'s brother started naming out all of the curse words he \nknew... Then his mom came out and yelled at him... I honestly never had a \nresponse to that...\xef\xbb\xbf'

p42
aS"I'm a stat whore.... If my team is going to get them selves killed im not \ngoing into it too because it's best for my team... For example, im playing \ncontrol in Destiny and heavy ammo just arrived, I'm not going to capture a \nbase with everyone else just to get blown up. Anyway I don't think stat \nwhore is that bad.

aS"I just have to stop watching here and say something - don't worry, I will \nfinish, I'm really enjoying your videos, but I hope you realize that when \nyou say 'There aren't that many girl gamers, at least not on the games I \nplay' that you're wrong, and are part of the reason why so many women try \nnot to be apparent when gaming.\n\nStats don't mean anything so I'm not going to quote them, but we are there. \nIn every game. You just don't know it. Saying gender equality, and meaning \nit, is great. I greatly appreciate that. But you can't just say random crap \nthat isn't true about female gamers and expect us to enjoy your videos. Not \nthat I'm talking for all females that play games on the planet! Just the \ngiant horde of male and female gamers that I know personally and from what \nI've read on the leading studies on who is gaming now a days. \n\nTLDR; We are on that game. Oh, and that game you didn't think we were on? \nWe're there, too. And there are a lot of us. BE AFRAID - okay not really, \njust acknowledge that there are as many female gamers as there are male. \nBecause there are. \xef\xbb\xbf"

p83
aS'*The facts of being a girl gamer (or a girl who just so happens to play \ngames, for all those who identify with the title\'s reputation):*\n- Sick perverts who try to hit on you.\n- Weirdo\'s who try to find out your address\n- People who automatically assume your either fat, ugly, both, or you\'ll \nbang them.\n- Sexist assholes.\n- The, friends-but-I-wanna-be-more-than-friends, friend.\n- That one kid on your friends list who\'s grossly younger than you but \nlikes and tries to hit on you...\n-  "Relationships".\n- That one person in the lobby who KEEPS MOANING.\n- People who want to see you naked so they keep asking for pics.\n- Clingy-to-the-point-of-stalking people.\n- *Wishing you knew them for real.*\n\nEven if there ARE a lot of weirdo\'s out there, being a gamer in general is \nawesome! And I think it\'s not really about the game itself, it\'s more so \nabout the people you\'re playing with:)! Of course there are going to be \nsicko\'s and annoying people, but when you find people that you become \nfriends with, it makes everything SO WORTH IT, to the point where you just \ndon\'t care about all the MAGOTI\'s out there! You won\'t ever regret it, so \nlive life and have fun;D (I wasn\'t trying to be mean to guys, and if you \nnoticed, I never actually said it was guys, but I\'m only trying to write of \nthe things I know of for a fact, and that lies within the perspective of a \ngirl gamer). Thanks for reading!\nLOVE YOU ALL MY FELLOW NERDS AND NO-LIVES! XD (No matter what anyone says, \ngamers are the best type of people!)\xef\xbb\xbf'

p88
aS'Recent studies have actually stated that half of gamers are female, so why \ndoes Ryan " in his experience" believe that girls are rare in the gamin \ncommunity? Because of the trolls and the douchebags that target women \nSPECIFICALLY. And girls are told to not draw attention to themselves if \nthey don\'t want to get harrassed.

aS'i dont think rage quiting is bad. games are supposed to be fun, so if youre \nnot having fun, you should just leave so you dont take your anger out on \nyour team. In counterstrike, i dont like it when anyone leaves for any \nreason, even if we have to kick them because they are afk or trolling. but \nif they themselves quit, you can at least surrender, which is better for \nyour rank, because ELO is based on individual rounds, so you dont have to \nlose more rounds than you need to if you surrender \xef\xbb\xbf'

Ain\'t nothing u or me or anyone else is gonna do about it, its human \nnature to be a douche just look at how much they start screaming like \nmonkeys when u said gender equality like 10 times xD this is 1 thing u \ncannot run away from, solution to that problem is a bullet for each of \nthose types of ppl, i guess in that case we would have more freedom and \nspace not to mention less annoyance but look at it this way, those "magoti" \nwhich is funny kinda sounds like maggots xD r actually taking your job, \nhow? by being hilarious with their stupidity, i tell ya nothing more funny \nwhen getting on league and laughing my arse off at the "ks i reportyu" \ncomments, nice video and all funny to most of us we had a good laugh but on \na serious note the "magoti" will never stop and it\'s the same way outside \nthe net as it is on the inside, if u wanna stop it dude, load that gun \nstart shooting no other way. oh and \ninb4ragerstocountercommentme4noreason@all cuz i ain\'t reading replies to \nthis post anyway xD peaceeeeeeeeeeeee ooooooooout\xef\xbb\xbf'

However, one problem I, \nas a female, experience is trouble cooperating with different genders. I'm \nguessing guys have the same problem, but it depends on the sexuality. \nWhenever I try to help a female, or need help and the only source of it is \na female, they usually don't bat a lash, and they suddenly start talking \nwhen the guy needs help. This also happens with guys, I need help or I try \nto help and then they think I'm hitting on them. I wish we just had default \nsettings. :/ Maybe then we could stop fretting over our gender preferences \nand actually play the game with our fellow team mates. \xef\xbb\xbf"

There's ways to rectify it, but it's still \nreally annoying.  \nI finally figured out how to make it so I can no longer be spammed, but \nuntil then it seemed like I'd get spammed at the most inconvenient time.  \nGee, I wish I had a mount or gold or *_____*.

Not ALL guys online are trying to flirt with \nyou, some of them actually want to be friendly, get off your high horses. \nThe whole video relates to you unless your not a real gamer, focusing on \njust one thing just proves the point that most females who game just want \nattention. \n\n"I\'m a girl gamer who games"\n"I\'m a girl gamer who gets hit on online"\n\nUm no, your a *gamer* not girl gamer.\n\nThrow that term in the trash please. \xef\xbb\xbf'

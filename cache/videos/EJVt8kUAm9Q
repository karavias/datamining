aNaS'Guys bromance has TWO definitions. Starting with the common one.\n\nBromance (Common definition): Friends that you "love" but not in a gay way. \nIts liking another guy so much that if you loved him anymore it would be \ngay. Its as close to the line between straight and gay as possible. It\'s \ncool but this video expresses both definitions... also people cannot tell \nthe difference between gay and bromance as bromance can look gay. You just \nhave to make it so it doesnt seem/look gay.\n\nBromance (V2): A way to act gay with guys without being called gay. But it \ndoes make you gay.\n\nThey say bromance can make guys gay so id stay away from it if youre \nstraight. These guys are NOT gay btw.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p1880
aS'Verse 1\nIts like Eminem and Dr. Dre\nIf I loved you more I might be gay\nAnd when I\'m feeling down\nYou know just what to say\nYou my homie, Yeah you know me\nAnd if you ever need a wingman\nI\'d let any girl blow me off\nCus you\'re more important than the rest\nI confess, I\'m a mess\nIf I\'m not hanging with my BFF\nYou know its true, you my male boo,\nNow sing the chorus with me if you\'re feeling the same way too.\n\n\nChorus\nBromance, nothing really gay about it\nNot, that there\'s anything wrong with being gay\nBromance, SHouldn\'t be ashamed or hide it\nI love you in the most heterosexual way.\n\nVerse 2\nHold me\nTo a promise that I"ll be the kind of the friend that in the end\nWill always keep you company\nBecause when the world gets tough\nAnd times get hard\nI will always love you, I\'ll be your bodyguard\nCus you\'re my bestie, and if you test me\nI\'ll prove it time and time again, I got your back until the end\nA brotha from anotha motha never knew how much I loved ya\nTill i started singing this song... huh?\n\n\nChorus\nBromance, nothing really gay about it\nNot, that there\'s anything wrong with being gay\nBromance, SHouldn\'t be ashamed or hide it\nI love you in the most heterosexual way.\n\nBridge\nNow that I told you how I feel\nHope you feel the same way too\nBUT if you dont, this song was just a joke\nBUT if you do, I LOVE YOU\n\n\nChorus\nBromance, nothing really gay about it\nNot, that there\'s anything wrong with being gay\nBromance, SHouldn\'t be ashamed or hide it\nI love you in the most heterosexual way.\xef\xbb\xbf'

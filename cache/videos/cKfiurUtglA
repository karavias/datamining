I HAVE JUST TROLOLED U! I guess .J.B. rock was made when adults \nwanted to make a song that people over 10 would listen to, but they didn\'t \nlike rock music and thought it wrecks brains so they included "Rock" in the \ntitle and made a song THEY thought was good and put it on the radio. It, \nsucks really bad.\xef\xbb\xbf'

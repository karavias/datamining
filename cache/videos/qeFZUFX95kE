aS'i was wondering about this earlier.... why "fuck you" is socially \nunacceptable but "i dont wanna play with you cuz your UGLY" is...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p11
aS'Censorship kills kids.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS'You know if someone ever says stocks and stones may break your bones but \nwords can never hurt you. Throw a dictionary at them and ask how does that \nfeel\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS"I'm not really one to swear in real life but if u think of it real hard \ndoes the word fuck have a meaning? If it does I would like to hear it. I \nmean bitch has a meaning,so does cunt and ass but fuck is just a bunch of \nletters that u ppl call a swear word. So if fuck is a bad word when it has \nno meaning does that mean that clat is also a swear word? I mean its just a \nbunch of random letters I'm just trying to say think smarter ppl\xef\xbb\xbf"
p14
aS'I didn\'t know what "gay" & "lesbian" & all those other swear words meant or \nthat they were bad until I was in fourth freaking grade, & people made \njokes about stuff like that all the time, then they laughed but I wouldn\'t \nbecause I had no idea what it meant, then they thought I was lame & had no \nsense of humor. Like, I would have to ASK what it meant, which made me look \nreally stupid. xD It was kind of sad. Then, when I got into fifth grade & \nwatched "the video", I finally figured out what it meant, how babies were \nmade, ect. I was basically the only kid who didn\'t know anything about that \nstuff because my parents hid it from me. So, I started making jokes out of \nit because I thought it was still "cool", but then got caught all the time \n& got in trouble. Then came the cursing. I didn\'t know what that meant \neither, so I did it all the time, then got in trouble, & the cycle \ncontinues. It was just pathetic.\n\nI\'m trying to say that you shouldn\'t hide this stuff from your kids. Just \ntell them if they ask, or tell them when they\'re young so they have some \nperspective of what\'s going on or what\'s going to go on anyway. They\'re \ngoing to have their own experience with things like that anyway, so why not \nprepare them? I\'ve been thinking about stuff like this too, now, because of \nwhat happened when I was younger, & he makes a good point. Why hide it from \nus when we\'re young? We\'re going to get older, then have no idea what to \ndo, then seem like a stupid adult who has no clue what to do with life. \nPeople don\'t need to swear all the time, but it helps relieve stress & \nanxiety, rather than holding it in. :/ So, if it\'s bad, then I don\'t know \nwhat to do with the world.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p18
aS'That is true. Censoring something is really stupid. Like the invention of \nclothes. We are supposed to be "natural". We are animals to. We are not \nsupposed to make buildings and have different languages. I feel to \noverpowered that we have these things and have pets. Who ever made these \nthings are really really stupid.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p19
aS'As a writer, I understand the differences in using one word to another. If \nyou ask me, using swear words in actual situations isn\'t bad at all. \nSometimes using the word "darn" doesn\'t come close to the anger or emotion \nthat we feel. I just wish people would know better on using words. There\'s \npeople out there that use "Fuck" in ever fucking sentence or using it out \nof context. That\'s when I draw the line at swearing. Some people even use \n"Fuck" when they\'re standing in line in a quiet setting. Out of context \ndude, keep the more aggressive words to yourself. Ain\'t no one wants to \nhear about your expression at that point. Or, for example in the movie KICK \nASS when the little girl keeps using so much swearing with her father. I \nfeel like at that point, with kids, their dad should teach them better than \njust juggling swearing into every verb, adjective, or adverrb.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"Lets delete all PG 13 Than Delete all BAD GAMES Censor all chest and  don't \nlet the kids kill their self LET THEM FIGURE OUT THEM SELF DONT LET THEM \nUSE THE INTERNET!! just for kids games SAVE YOUR KIDS BE A CENSORED PARENT \nMAKE YOUR KIDS CLEAN!\xef\xbb\xbf"

p22
aS'If I grow up and if my son or daughter ask me "Dad, when did I came from?". \nI would say to my son/daughter "when your my mom and I sex my penis went to \nher vagina and my cum/sperm went through your mom\'s vagina and met an egg \ncell and became a baby and that is you".\nSon/Daughter: ooohhhhhh......

aS'Normally I don\'t comment, but here I must, because I feel the same way. I \ndon\'t get why word should be censored, why people gasp and look at you like \nyou\'re some sort of low life because you say you said this or that. \nSeriously, it\'s just a freaking word!!! It\'s not like it will poison you or \nmake trees rot, yet some people act as if acid just spilled out of your \nmouth and will burn them. And I hate the "ladies should not say that" It \nseriously pisses me off. That said, I\'m glad I watched this video.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Why aren't men's boob censored ? \nBecause they are little ? Because they don't have milk ? Damn this world is \nhard to understand. If one day I become the president of the United States, \nbras are going to be BANNED from the country. Dayummm -_- \xef\xbb\xbf"
p39
aS"I think these words are kind of offensive. If someone calls you a piece of \nshit, they're telling you that you're the equivalent of poop. And if \nsomeone calls you a bitch, you're being told that you're no better and not \nany more intelligent than a dog (maybe even the equivalent of calling a \ngirl a whore).\n\nThat's just my take on it though.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p40
aS'Plus, I DO tend to curse in my mind a lot XD, even out of the simplest \nthing.\n*Books closes, loses page* DAMN YOU, YOU MOTHERFUCKIN SON OF A BITCH BITCH \nSON CUNT FUCKTARD YOU DESERVE TO DIE YOU ASSHOLE FUCK YOURSELF CUZ NO ONE \nWANTS TO FUCK YOU\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Here is one weird censor thing I have noticed in movies and tv that I do \nnot get.  Why is it okay for them to show naked male babies, full frontal \nnudity included, but you never see any naked female babies like that?  It \nhas always struck me as being so damn odd.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p80
aS'When I was 3, I asked my Mom how do girls get pregnant, she told me \nstraight up,"From sex" Which led to more questions like what is sex and she \nsaod a dick in a vagina.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I agree with Ryan words shouldn't be censored like people say the words all \nthe time at almost any age and if someone is to young to know them then \nthey probably shouldn't be watching whatever it is. and i also agree with \nryan on the clothing side of it to like whats the difference between a male \nboob and a females becides the milk there bolth made of fat and have \nsimilar shapes and womens bikinis are basically the same as there underwear \nsometimes even less\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Dear Ryan, What would you do in a Zombie Apocalypse? \xef\xbb\xbf'
p96
aS"Swear words really have no meaning to me, they're just synonyms for other \nwords we can say. Hell, pussy and cunt mean the same thing literally, but \npussy is more socially acceptable than cunt.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p97
aS'U know that guys can produce mill too rite \xef\xbb\xbf'
p98
aS"Censorship does make sense in my opinion, but it's over-used beyond all \nreason. Media really should re-evaluate what's inproper to show or say so \nthat you don't get all of those silly examples you showed in the video.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p99
aS'YES THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL!!!!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p100
aS'I guess its just impolite to swear. I mean how disturbing would it be if a \nbaby curses at someone.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p103
aS"That's right Ryan so I can say FUCK\xef\xbb\xbf"
p104
aS"To me the censorship in the USA sounds very weird because seriously, boobs. \nThere is nothing weird in them, but instead, as you said, killing and \nexplosions in a film are apparently more acceptable. Well of course maybe \nsex scenes shouldn't be showed to kids at a too early age but at like 8-9 \nyears it might be normal already\xef\xbb\xbf"
p105
aS"Who made the concept bad words? Any word I'm saying can turn into a curse \nword in the future. For example Mallop that can become a bad word\xef\xbb\xbf"
p106
aS'I think there should be sensitivity over nudity, it can lead to immature \nchildren.\nEither that or most my class are spoiled brats.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p107
aS'This video pretty much changed my view on censorship.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p108
aS'All good points.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p109
aS" I hate when they censor DVDs in my countries. and they do that ALL THE \nfucking time. They don't censor swearing, but they censor nudity, sometimes \nthey even censor cleavages....  I mean, that's so stupid. I don't live in \nUSA where almost every people can afford DVDs. I live in indonesia where \nmost original DVDs are too expensive for the lower middle class to buy. \nWhat pissed me off is the fact that after all those money I spent for a \nmovie...I can't even watch the 'WHOLE' thing. This reduces the amount of \npeople buying original DVDs, and raise the number of pirated DVD (which \narent censored) purchase, of course. Not only I consider this dumb, but SO \nMORONIC I want to stab the guy behind censorship in my country.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p110
aS'Just when he saw the dawg! Lmao!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p111
aS"I agree. It makes no sense. They're just words, yet somehow, people seem to \ntake offense to it. You can say an everyday English word, and no one would \ntake offense, but if you say the curse word equivalent of it, people would \ngo freaking out! Doesn't make any sense whatsoever \xef\xbb\xbf"
p112
aS'I so agree to this. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p113
aS'Me to\xef\xbb\xbf'
p114
aS'I agree Censorship  makes no sense .... only not open minded people advote \nfor that\xef\xbb\xbf'
p115
aS"It's like censoring a middle finger. It's like oh, you got me, what could \nbe behind that? A cow (lol), an umbrella?\xef\xbb\xbf"
p116
aS'Honestly censorship makes no sense tome either but a word like \nF\xc2\xa3\xc2\xa3k was made as a bad version of sex.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p117
aS"I've never seen Niggahigas videos b4 but this was on the mark. It's true \ncensorship may have bad causes but the origin prospect of censorship was \nedict to allow children to develop. They may be alphabets that people just \ndecided to have meaning but they do have meaning. When you tell someone to \ngo to hell regardless of whether they believe hell exist the connotations \ndo have meaning. There is purpose for censorship as convoluted as it is in \nour time. That's because of business. Especially in U.S.A. and JP. Sex \nsells therefore people try to bypass the wordings of the law and expose as \nmuch as they can so they gain more money/attention etc.There is purpose in \ncensorship. But the selfishness of others affected how it should be \nperceived.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Also to add on, even when you censor, people know what you're saying. Like \nif I say F**k. Everybody knows what the two asterisks are supposed to be. \nIf there is a censored dick, everyone knows whats behind the black (No \nracism there) bar. And Btw, even if you don't censor and the kid sees or \nhears that, they wont change because they probably will hear or see it \nlater on in their life.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p238
aS'When I say "fuck" or "shit" it\'s just words with different meanings. People \nswear because it feels good to get it out of your system. Like when you \nstub your toe, it\'s not like you can scream "Holy shiza, this hurts like \ncrazy" it feels better to scream "HOLY MOTHER OF FUCKING GOD THAT HURT LIKE \nA FUCKING BITCH" Bad words shouldn\'t exist. Same goes with a middle middle \nfinger. I got sent to the office in middle school because I was jokingly \npointing  middle finger at a friend. Honestly it\'s a fucking finger. \nHonestly it\'s fucking retarded. Same goes with the word retarded. Saying \nsomeone is a retard isn\'t an insult. The smartest man in the world is \nmentally retarded. People need to just get over themselves about "bad \nwords"\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I have a different reason of why censorship doesn\'t make sense, but I agree \nwith this, too. My reason is like, we can say the words that have the same \ndefinition as the word we can\'t say, like for example, we can say the word \ncrap or poop, but we can\'t say the word "shit."\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"   Censorship is a huge issue for my friends and I. We were all members of \nour school's literary club and we could write anything and get away with \nit, and I mean ANYTHING. However, this year we got a new adviser for the \nclub and she censors everything. No more cursing, death, sex, cannibalism, \nsuicide, venting about real life problems, referring to real life people, \ngraphic methods of torture, ungraphic methods of torture, and worse of all, \nif you write her a beautiful essay on how the club's turned to sh*t since \nshe took charge, you get kicked out.\n   I don't think that last sentence is grammatically correct but whatever.\n   What irritates me most is that she claims she's doing this because it's \nNew Jersey law. Okay, so then why weren't we censored last year? Why can \nthe drama club write and perform skits that contain profanity and have dark \ncontent, and still be praised for it? Artists tend to write dark things, or \nat least about things that they've experienced and how that impacted them. \nBut no writing about real people or real problems anymore. This bugs me so \nmuch....sigh. I guess I just really wanted to read my cannibalism poem to \nthe club... Oh well. It's a good thing I can vent on the internet ('cause \neveryone so appreciates it *inset sarcasm here*), because I know I wouldn't \nhave been able to read this in club.

My oldest son is mildly autistic, and I actually had to \nencourage and teach him how to cuss properly so that he could blend in with \nhis peers better. Only prudes like prudes. And prudes will invent ways to \nbe offended so if we give in to their "no bad words" censorship, they will \nfind something else to be offended by and take something else away.

p575
aS"I always think of words that have the same meaning. It was ok to say poop \nor crap at home or in public, but shit was not allowed. They all mean the \nsame thing, what's the big deal? Why were we allowed to say butt and not \nass when both mean the same thing? And when someone puts up their middle \nfinger on TV or something, they blur it out. Most people watching know what \nit is and it's just a finger, what's the deal?\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Censorship is pointless, the world is totally fucked up and has so much \nshit going on in it, and censoring it in movies, games etc. Just makes it \nworse. So let's make a movie rated R kids can't watch it and it's based on \na true story about sex trafficking, drugs, or shit that's going on. That's \nmaking our children less aware, the more you experience and know the \nbetter. Words are just words, those who let some petty words bother them \nare weak willed.

aS'Come live in Denmark! In Denmark, they have every swear word in the English \nlanguage in Danish but nobody cares if you say it. They *are* considered \n"bad words" but no more than stupid, ugly and things like that. If you \nwatch a Danish movie (which are sometimes quite popular throughout the \nworld) for example \'Jagten\' which is a good movie btw the 5 year old kid \ntells his teacher he needs to go to the toilet where the teacher replies \n"We\'re in a rush. Shit or piss?" "Shit." "Hurry."\n They swear on daytime TV and nobody cares. Although there is *ONE* word \nwhich may be considered offensive and parents may not like you saying which \nliterally means "cancer eat me up" but they will still show iton TV, it is \nonly bad for the person saying it really but nobody cares. It\'s like \ncursing yourself I guess?\n\n xD yeah... Danish makes more sense, no censorship\xef\xbb\xbf'

p867
aS"I think cencoring words is stupid, because when we act like that children \nwill grow to think that those words are bad and their reacton will be \ndifferent than if we just used them like other words. Words don't really \nhurt, but if you use them like that they start to hurt\xef\xbb\xbf"

p926
aS"I feel that the reason there is censorship, and why I appreciate you \ncensoring your videos, is because it shows that the person has boundaries. \nThis is a tiny bit slippery slope, but when a person starts swearing, it \noften means they have no problem with other things that are more damaging. \nI don't mind people stubbing their toe and yelling a swear word (provided \nit isn't in the presence of children under 10), but there are too many \npeople who are either too lazy or too verbally challenged to use any \ndescriptive words and therefore stick to swearing... \xef\xbb\xbf"

p934

p981
aS'Yeah the fact that violence is ok for younger people to see but not sexual \nstuff really confuses me...\nLike when your 13 your parents are like "Oh come watch this guy stab this \nother guy" but as soon as theres someone half naked "I don\'t think you \nshould be watching this"\xef\xbb\xbf'

I would feel worse if someone told me to \nshut up than if someone called me a bitch. You know why? Everyone is \nalready desensitized to curse words so you might as well just forget about \ntaking that LONG pathway JUST to make people hurt more when others curse. \n(If you don\'t have something positive to reply, don\'t say it.)'

p1397
aS'Censorship is kind of pointless. If a kid has already learned the words, \nwhich most of them will by 13 or so, the censor bar and bleeping won\'t stop \nthem from knowing which word was said. "Go ____ yourself!" Only one word \ncame to mind to fill in the blank. Am I right? "You\'re a piece of ____!" I \nguarantee that you know what word I left out. "You\'re an ass____!" I wrote \nthat one like that because weirdly the second half of the word is what gets \ncensored. But I know that you know the entire thing.'

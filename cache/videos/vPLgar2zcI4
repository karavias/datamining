S"I dunno. I'd probably save the dog. The human will most likely die in a few \nyears from some other equally random and unimportant event without ever \naccomplishing anything worthwhile.\n\n... That's true of the dog too from a social perspective, given that the \nonly things dogs ever get stories in the news for accomplishing are saving \nhuman lives (oh look, more proof of what you're saying) but at least the \ndog probably isn't as much of a douche as the human.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p10
aS"Animals eat animals...\n... Humans are animals, it's the way of nature!\n\\ \\\n\\_______\\\n\\___/\\__/\n\xef\xbb\xbf"
p11
aS'You know Ryan, that was just really mean\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS'I would save the dog.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS'I almost cried after this! I love my Chihuahua so much! And when Ryan held \nhis cute little dog and said, "I love my dog", I felt so sad when his dog \nlicked him and THEN he says, "Not anymore", I was so upset even though it \nwas fake! Ryan, no offense, but I really hated the end!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p14
aS"I love how we can't eat animals but it's ok for animals to eat animals. I \nlove animals with every fiber in my body but omg we gotta eat what we gotta \neat. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p15
aS'I love animals and yes I do eat meat...do you want to know why? SCIENCE, \nyou got the food chain, we eat animals to survive. what I don\'t agree is \nkilling an animal for the sake of it. One thing I don\'t understand, if we \neat animals and they don\'t really put up a fight why cant animals eat us, \n(Im not saying this should happen) I mean we are part of the food chain and \nwe help each other, we are all animals but we treat them so differently. \n(Again Im just thinking this in a "would make sense" sense...ya im just \nconfusing myself, im just gonna go...bye..)\xef\xbb\xbf'
p16
aS'Its not like eating that juicy delicious bacon is going to make a pig. Plus \nalmost 100% vegetarians have more fragile bodies than meay eaters. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p17
aS'I wish you lived as a cow which lives her entire life locked in a cage and \nbeing kicked and abused only for her milk and her calf is starved to death \nbecause they are taken away right the moment they were born so that we can \nhave milk for our cakes! Animals are very intelligent probably more then \nyou are... and if we worked more with them we would be much more advanced \nthan we are with someone like you. They have emotions like we do and were \nborn free!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p18
aS'Today is thanksgiving \xef\xbb\xbf'
p19
aS'"But do you REALLY love animals? Think about it..." Of course I do, Ryan! \nActually, unlike you, I would have saved the dog.. ;-; anyway, I\'m a \nvegetarian and I think it\'s so funny when meat eaters say "you need meat to \nsurvive" AHAHAHAHAH. um, no. you don\'t need meat. Paul McCartney is 72 and \nhas been a vegetarian for MAAAAAAANY years. You think you need meat to \nsurvive? Well, I think intelligence is more important and you\'re clearly \nlacking it.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p20
aS'you retard  an animals life is more valuable than a humans \nlife!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n \xef\xbb\xbf'
p21
aS'human bodies are made to eat and digest meat\xef\xbb\xbf'
p22
aS"why does no one value the plant's lives?\nThey are living things too, but there's no group of people preaching about \nthe slaughtering of innocent plants!\nSee, this is how nature works. We kill those of one species to ensure the \nsurvival of our own. If we were to only eat food that doesn't come from \nanother organism's life, we'd all be dead. The only food left would be \ndairy, which involves forcibly impregnating a cow, which may be crueler to \nthe cows than just killing them.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p23
aS'have anyone tasted bacon and egg? do i need to say anything more?? its \ndelicious.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p24
aS"It's a good thing that there are vegans/vegetarians. Because as Ryan said: \nit leaves more for the rest of us. I know he was joking but it's true. We \nface over population and are already stretching things thin. If everyone in \nthe world ate meat, then this would be a problem... \n\nStill, NOT eating meat isn't going to make us kill less as we're already \nkilling basically as much as we can and more people keep coming into the \nworld. All not eating meat will do is leave enough for the rest of the \nworld.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p25
aS"Can't I save both? I could ran and pick up the dog (Trying not to be \nscared) and yell at the person. But if the person was wearing headphones \nand can't hear, then with the dogs in one of my hands, I will use my other \nhand and push the person away and after that, I will ran away from the road \nwith the dog. Isn't that better? Well not really for me since I need to \ntouch a dog and I have fear of dogs and more of a cat person. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p26
aS"i would save the dog anyday over some stupid worthless human, i hate people \nand im embarrased to be one, the things they do to animals is one of the \nmost gruesome and disgusting things ever, and u know what i hate even \nmore?! when a dog bites a kid and everybody and their mother loses their \nminds and then they take the dogs precious life away just because he bit a \ndumbass kid who's gonna grow up and help destroy this world just like the \nrest of u. and while im at it might as well name one of the worlds most \ndisturbing slaughter ever to me The taiji dolphin slaughter, every year the \njapanease hunt 20,00 dolphins a year and kill them in the most inhumane way \npossible first they chase them from their home with banger poles causing a \nwall of sound thats hard to escape, then they net them off in the cove (its \na movie watch it) and then mercillesly slaughter them they stick metal \npoles in to the dolphins blowhole through its spine leaving the dolphin to \nslowly and painfully die off infront of its family that would be in the \nexact same position after the dolphin has died, since i found out about \nthis act i lost all hope for humanity i hate this world and i hate people, \ni hate them with a passion\xef\xbb\xbf"
p27
aS"It's ironic how vegans eat the main food source for many animals.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p28
aS'If vegans love animals to that extent, please, do not wear any leather \njackets, belts, shoes, lipstick, remove those seats in your car, throw out \nyour sofa and socks.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p29
aS"Yeah, I'd probably save the dog. UNLESS IT'S A SHIH TZU.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p30
aS"I hate cow meat, not because I love cows, I hate them,but bequest it is \ndiscussing... I'm sounding like a drama queen/a bitch right now xD \xef\xbb\xbf"
p31
aS"it only depends, but me, I LOVE animals. You see the only reason humans \nkill other humans is just to kill because you can't rlly eat a \nhuman... (unless your sick and twisted) think about it. say a bear for \nexample; it killed a human when it was in THE BEARS habitat. theres a \nreason. Bears don't speak english unlike humans. we can speak things out \n(unless ur a murderer) so no problems occur. but dogs, cats, hamsters, etc. \nWe think they're very important as a house pet but, our ancestors used to \neat or kill their ancestors (dog - wolf, cat - lion, hamster - rat) in fact \nwe kill them more today (except for wolves of endangered species, laws of \nthat stuff) Yeah Native Americans (no offence srry if Social Studies is a \nbad subject for you XD) only killed to eat because their were no laws or \nstuff.... and anyway, all animals have a role in life, even if you don't \nsee it. yes (srry) I'm not a vegen (yet >:D) but when I was young, I \nlearned that chickens were 'technically' abused because farmers cut their \nbeaks off to get eggs :(  also the 'good' farmers let the chickens roam \nfree until they lay eggs for the humans (unless the egg had a little chick \nin it) so, I'm not trying to MAKE you a vegen, just a thought :) (a long \nthought)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p32
aS'2:01 THAT FACE!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p33
aS"My teacup Chihuahua has the computer room all to himself, but he can't open \nthe sliding glass door so it's like a silent jail to him... But luckily, in \nthe winter he can sleep in a box with cushions in the living room. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p34
aS'Humans are more valuable than animals.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p35
aS"I'm vegetarian, and honestly the people who do what that lady did embarrass \nme... Yes, I believe the facts need to get out there about how much \nhealthier and humane our diet is, but seriously, don't bring it up to every \nrandom person you meet. If someone wants to know about it, that's great! \nBut don't start a debate that's not necessary. It solves nothing. If you \ntry to make meat-eaters feel stupid, it's not going to make them think very \npositively about vegetarian/vegan choices. And the same goes for \nmeat-eaters! Please don't try and tell us we're wrong, we know the truth \nabout animal by-products. We've done way more research on the topic, and \nyour snide comments won't change our beliefs. No need to start a fight. Let \nus do our own thing, and you can carry on with yours if that's what you \ndecide.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p36
aS"Here vegan I'll give you a tip\nIf you love animal an saving them why are you eating their food? Lol jk\xef\xbb\xbf"
p37
aS"I agree with what vegans and vegetarians stand for but I dont think I could \ndo it. I dont love meat, but living without it entirely would be difficult. \nI love turkey and venison and fish. Im trying to cut down on dairy (its \nweird that we drink another animals milk really, and even if its originally \ngood for you all the processing it goes through is really bad milks not all \nthat great for you) but my options are coconut milk, which is expensive, \nalmond milk, which tastes like a bitter cookie, and soy milk, which I cant \nhave because it has estrogen similar hormones in it and my family has a \nhistory of breast cancer which can be caused by that so...and i also love \nice cream. cant live without ice cream. I'll do what i can to support \npeople against animal cruelty but that wont include converting. Honestly, \nthose people who try to turn others into vegetarians so fiercely are no \nbetter than homophobics, over religious people, and telemarketers, because \nwhether theyre right or not doesnt matter because no one will care if youre \nannoying as fuck. (just so no one gets mad, i have nothing against \nhomosexuals or any religion it was just an example)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p38
aS"1:52 I'd stop right there.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p39
aS"omg the only reason I hate vegetarians is that they make me feel so bad \neverytime I eat jello, hamburger or anything that relates to animals.\nI mean, I don't eat beans but you don't see me telling everyone who eats it \nthat it makes you fart like crazy.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p40
aS"I don't get the point of being vegan. Not all animal related food products \nkill animals. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p41
aS' I personally used to think animals are better than humans/humen until I \nrealized that humans/humen are animals too. If you think about it we were \nborn four legged! Yes, I eat meat but that is because we are (I am) part of \nthe food web too! If I stop eating meat but other people still eat it then \npeople would still continue killing for meat. If we all stop meat then the \nanimals\' meat will be wasted (I\'m talking/typing about the animals killed \nwhen we decided to stop eating meat) but then if we eat those meat then \npeople would continue killing animals (a bit complicated to understand). \nAdmit it, were part of the food web. \n\n\nPersonal note (because of something I read yesterday): Yes, I\'m 12 years \nold if you are wondering. There are at least one or two people that \nmentions "Are you 11 or 12?" or "Its probably an eleven or twelve year \nold." in majority of the discussions on the internet. I want these people \nto understand that age does not define maturity. Yes, maybe majority of the \n11-12 year olds could be immature but that doesn\'t mean they all are. I \nread something on a site yesterday that 11-12 year olds forget that they \nare 11-12 year old when they\'re on the internet (swearing/"language" \ntowards others) and that their grammar is bad. I know myself that I DO NOT \nswear, not on the internet nor when I\'m speaking using my voice. I always \nedit my comments before I post them but admit it, there will always be \nlittle to no grammar in everyone\'s comments. Honestly, everyone will make a \nspelling mistake at least once (people that live long enough to learn how \nto speak a language and use it). Everyone makes mistakes but why is it that \nwhen an eleven or twelve year old makes a very simple mistake, people \nnotice it? I\'m just wondering, is this going to follow my age group or is \nit going to "stay" at 11-12 year olds, in other words are people going to \nstart discrimminating 13-14 year olds when I\'m 13-14 years old? I\'m really \ntired of seeing these type of discussions ("oh it\'s an 11-12 year old" type \nof discussion) and I want people to realize how age doesn\'t "make" a person \nimmature. \xef\xbb\xbf'

p47
aS'I can never go vegan. I lack the dedication. And come on, animals eat other \nanimals every day. Humans are just animals with the intelligence to inquire \ninto the truth of our existence with questions like these: Who am I? Why am \nI here? What is the purpose of my existence? Why am I suffering? How can I \nliberate myself from this suffering condition?. (I know this is a dumb \nargument, but that is what came to my mind.)\xef\xbb\xbf'
p48
aS'I would save the dog or animal cause the car would run over the person the \nperson would die and the other person will die in jail but if I did save \nthe person they both live but some point there gonna die and the dog can \nlive longer than a person so then the animal would have a long happy life \nplus animals are way cuter \xef\xbb\xbf'

Also if I had to choose to between \nsaving a dog and a human I could go either way. But more on the animal \nbecause there are many humans.

aS'I would save the doggy :) I had a similar situation... Ok so here it goes \nit\'s a long story so yeah... One time me and my friends were going to have \na water balloon fight so I went home to get my bathing suit on then my \nfriends came pounding on the door so I opened it after I got in my bathing \nsuit and they showed me this hour old baby kitten and I said "WHAT IS THAT \nTHING EWW!" Because it looked like a dead rat... Anyways I got a paper \ntowel and held it to examine it and ants started to crawl out of it\'s mouth \nand ears so I picked all the ants that were trying to eat the kitten off \nand talked to my parents about maybe saving it... So they said nope... I \nlayed him in the sun and waited a couple hours crying my eyes out... So I \nwent back to bury it and you guessed it... After 4 hours in the sun the cat \nwas still alive... So I picked it up put it in a container and fed it some \nof my puppy\'s special milk we got him and I hadn\'t eaten all day and the \nnight I was watching the kitten... So in the morning my father drove me to \nthe rescue center... They found a mommy cat that would take care of it and \nfeed it... 1 month later we got a letter saying that the cat was adopted!! \nI named him miracle because he was my little miracle :) even though I \ndidn\'t get to keep him I still love him!\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I would save the dog even if the guy was a president \xef\xbb\xbf'
p114
aS"I love animals, but my thought has always been that if I don't eat meat, \nsomeone else will. The world is not going to stop killing animals just \nbecause some people don't eat them. By the time you see , for example, a \npackage of bacon at the store, the animal has already been killed. One \nperson not buying the bacon will not bring the animal back to life, or save \nany more, since some other person will buy the same package of bacon the \nfirst person walked away from. I'm not trying to disrespect anyone or \nchange their views, I am simply expressing my opinion.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p115
aS"I'm vegetarian, planning to go vegan very soon. It's actually really easy, \nall you need is a bit of self control.

To love \nan animal because you can treat it like trash and they still love you (but \na human wouldn\'t) says leaps and bounds more about the animal person being \na rotten human than it does about anything else.\n\nNext time you meet someone who says "OMG, animals are the best and humans \nsuck" you are witnessing a human who sucks.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Also, I do have to agree \nthat Humans are just animals, I see nothing wrong in animals being killed \nHUMANELY for the reason to be food as animals kill animals unless they are \nherbivores.

aS'One thing that me and my buddies thought once, and I am not going to force \nthis, but I just want to introduce it to your thoughts: So the vegans have \nvarious reasons not to eat meat, but two of them are major, one is that \nthey think eating animals is gross and the other reason is that it \ndecreases population of the animals. However, at the same time they are \nalso eating the exact same vegetables and other non-meat products on the \nmarket that are supposed to keep the same animals they want to save from \nstarving to death. Either way they will get killed, but even though we \nstill need a reasonable amount of vegetables and other non-meat products in \nour diet, at least there will still be some left for the animals to survive \nand continue providing a large chunk of met and non-meat products for both \nanimals and humans alike.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p259
aS"Actually human is the most noxious species on Earth. Its destroying its \nhome along with the home of every other species here as well. Just a \nspecies along others, used to hoarding natural resources as much as it can, \nwhich has been essential to its survival when societies were still small \nand undeveloped. Now there's nothing to save us from ourselves because were \nliving in a totally different world than what the evolution has habituated \nus to, yet our genes make us pursue resources and reproduct as much as \npossible. So let's say, in the next one/a couple hundred years the majority \nof us are going to die of war of resources and/or natural catastrophies if \nglobal warming and its multiplicative effects come true on time and we \nwon't start making one children per pair at maximum, or even worse, our \nexistence will result in Earth rapidly becoming inhabitable (except for \nbacteria, possibly).\nSo I'd say, let's run over that human and save the dog. Only the former has \nthe ability to destroy life irrevocably and on a large scale.\xef\xbb\xbf"

It's just a matter and \npreference of taste. I love animal to death, but if you offer me meat, \nwould I eat it?

By all means, eat meat, I have no qualms, but please \ntake into consideration your choices such as buying free range chickens \nover caged ones, and choosing the kinder option. (Caged chickens are fed \nsteroids to enable a fast and unnatural growth rate so they become big \nenough for slaughter at the mere age of 5 weeks.

aS"        Think about it this way; its been like this for a millenium.  The \ndinosaurs ate other dinosaurs for a source of protein and food.  We eat \nother mammals for a source of protein and food. Other animals do it too.  \nWhat are we doing different from all those other animals?  Species' need \nfood to survive and some eat plants. Some eat vegetables. Some are \nomnivores.  We are an example.  The reason why we get thrown in jail  for \nmurdering people is because it is morrally wrong.  You don't see other \nanimals killing each other for no reason whatsoever.  Come to think of it, \nwe should follow other animals' behavior.  We may be more technologically \nadvanced, but we still are... animals.  Although most people don't accept \nthat as a title, it's kinda obviously true.  We just consider ourselves \ndifferent in the sense that we are more technologically advanced.  You \ncan't complain that some humans eat meat, but it's exactly what many other \nspecies do.  We need to get sources of protein somewhere, and other animals \nis the most natural way.  I'm not hating on vegans, and they can't be \nhating on us either. \n\n        By the way. this is the longest comment I've ever typed up and if \nyou are still reading this you probably have nothing better to do (just \nlike me at the moment).  This comment is so long, I just added indents.  \nBut anyways, i believe my point has been stated and clearly proven.  People \ncannot be hating on others just because of their food choices; this is all \ndue to what the person feels is ideal.  \n\n        P.S. - Don't think I'm a teacher or an adult or anything; I'm just \nyour not-so-average thirteen year old.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"I love meat, but I love animals as well, I have my own pets and I know most \npeople love animals too and also most people wouldn't want to slaughter the \nanimals themselves.

It's nature, and we are part of it so I don't \ndeny myself of what nature has to offer.

p542
aS"Concerning vegans. So let me get this straight; animals are on equal \nstanding with people, therefore it is wrong to kill and eat animals and is \non par with horrible slaughter. So, if a wolf goes and kills a deer for \nfood, shouldn't you hate the wolf? If wolves are animals and therefore \nequal to humans, doesn't that mean you should hate the wolf just as much as \nthe human? You could argue that it's natural and part of their instinct, \nbut humans have been instinctively hunting and eating animals since ancient \ntimes; not to mention humans and animals are equal which makes us animals \ntoo, and if it's okay for wolves because they're animals this means it's \nokay for us since we're animals. . . (note, the predator doesn't have to be \na wolf, that's just the first thing that popped in my mind for an example)\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I dont like holding animals in captivity well ones that arent meant to be \npets, I dont see anything wrong with eating them through, its all part of \nlife, other animals eat other animals to survive and thats what were doing, \npeople dont realize how important meat is, Animal parts are in alot of  our \nfood like most gummy candy and if a vegan doesnt want to eat meat, its \ntheir problem i dont care more for us, id probably invite one to my house \nand eat meat right infront of them \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I have no problem in killing animals for food, but the companies that do it \ntreat the animals like shit and the food often isn't even that safe for \nhumans. I don't think veganism is the way and it's really expensive to even \ndo in some places. Plus the over production of plants for veganism has it's \nown ethical and environmental issues. In short, you can't win, you can only \nchoose what you think is the lesser of two evils. My answer to that is I \neat mostly fish and other meats on occasion, because it's less creepy then \nmeat produced in my country. I'm moving soon though to Sweden and don't \nhave to worry as much about GMO or how the animals are treated horribly \nbecause they've had animal rights laws for about 80 years.\nAlso, yes, you would be more likely to choose a human. Humans just as any \nother animal, cares about it's own species first before another, however, \nif it was say the life of one human vs 100 puppies/dogs, I'd probably pick \nthe puppies because that's 100 lives saved instead of one. Either way, it \nwould suck to have to choose. Almost like choosing between friends and \nfamily. For some people they like their friends more then their family.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with being a vegetarian for the sake of \nanimals.

Furthermore, \nfamiliarity will taint your view, most people would save their pet over a \nstranger- both if they could- but if they had to choose... \xef\xbb\xbf'

If I was on a \nboat about to sink, I would make DAMNED sure to save my loved ones first, I \nwouldn't start running around looking for other people and ditch my dog \nwhich has given me companionship for years over a stranger. I lost my dog \nto old age (had him half my life, since I was 13) over 1 year ago, and I \nstill wake up at night with tears streaming down my face because something \nin my mind remembered he's gone forever. I don't wake up crying over the \nneighbour next door moving away.\n\nI don't put humans over animals (have you seen how horrible people can \nbe?)I love the beings close to me and that includes my dogs. I also \nwouldn't save someone else's kid over my own father just because he's old \nand the kid isn't. Emotional attachment, love, blurrs out the borders \nbetween species and age differences.\n\nJust my 2 cents, based upon actually being in a dangerous situation with my \nloved ones. Oh, and my dog, saved me from violent situations more than \nonce. He > any person on the planet not part of my close family. R.I.P my \nfriend...\xef\xbb\xbf"

It's like animals killing other \nanimals for food. It's cruel but it's part of life. You can say we can live \non eating plants only but I doubt it.

I know \nthat you can never really replace a pet, and I love my dog very much just \nlike all of you would, and I hate animal abuse as well. But for crying out \nloud, have some common sense. It's a choice between a humans life and an \nanimals life. And I doubt that you really would choose the animals life. \nIt's like saying that, if you became a millionaire, you would donate the \nmoney to charity. For 99 percent of people, that would be an absolute lie. \nYou just say it to sound like a great person.

aS"So this Thanksgiving you're saying we can have everything except the \nturkey. So, Gramma puts out the veggies, stuffing, potatoes, gravy, \ncranberry sauce....then comes the turkey platter that special ceramic plate \nshe's been serving turkey on for the last 68 yrs on, only this year you \ngave her the guilt trip about slaughtering turkeys so she didn't make one, \nand her platter is empty except for the romaine lettuce she put on it. She \nwas upset in the kitchen, she thought about opening a can of tuna but \ndidn't want to kill dolphins or tunas, then she said hey, there's canned \nham but, it's not really ham more like mystery meat so you could be killing \na pig, moose, rare forest yeti? Now you're more like Hannibal. Oh, crap! \nGramma panics...maybe she can mold dry dog food and peanut butter together \nand pretend it's a turkey but, it's going to smell like peanuts and dog \nkibble!! Ahhh! Eat vegan you jerks! I only have to do this Thanksgiving \nthing once a year and now look! I have an old, empty turkey platter with \nromaine lettuce decorating it! I give up! I'm going to Long John Silver's \nand let them kill me some fish and hush puppies! Tee-hee\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Get this through your thick skulls people! We "Humans" Are animals as \nwell...  And that,s a scientific fact.

p795
aS"Geez, I never thought what Thanksgiving would be like for vegans...\n\nAnyway, I would do the exact opposite. I would save a dog over a human. \nHeck, I'd give my life to save a dog.

p798
aS'I will say any kind of life is life. So it means animal\'s life doesn\'t mean \nmore than human, or trees. Anything you eat came out from another lifeform. \nThat is why, whenever i said that the vegan updating their excuse to "its \nnot about the life, its about inflicting pain to animal, plant can\'t feel \npain" so in the end they are just another preachers, so sure of something \nand the reason didn\'t matter. (And for the pain stuff, of course plant \ncan\'t feel pain, first of all they don\'t have the necessary organ and nerve \nsystem, but they are a whole other kingdom and we can\'t even begin to try \nto understand how its like to have your leafs cut away) \xef\xbb\xbf'

p872
aS'Im not hating on anyone but think about it, that chicken or turkey or \nburger, or whatever is still going to be there wether they eat it or not. \nWe are still going to kill chickens or cows for there meat and the \nvegetarian is he only person who is letting it go to waste.....so the \nvegetarian is actually the one that let the animal die for \nnothing......yeah '

aS'I do'

aS"I would've saved the dog. :) And depending on my mood, I might kill the \nhuman afterwards, probably the driver too. I mean, they deserve it, the \ndriver is on his cellphone and the other moron is just standing on the \nstreet, I can understand the dog doing that, he is a dog after all and \nbesides, the dog would probably run away at the last moment while the human \nwould stand there in awe of the vehicle that is about to kill him. Instinct \nbeats intelligence. :)"
p877
aS'well yes, I agree that we have an intelligent and very unique way of \nkeeping relations; then again it does matter over reasons and how behaviour \nis seen like our relations are top because Humans are seen as a pack or \ngroup than an individual like a snake but there are some relations in the \nanimal kingdom better than ours like Wolves or Dolphins. We have different \nand a more complex way of expressing emotions which most animals cant \nbecause of their brain structure; I understand your point though'

p882
aS"Little children wouldn't understand why we kill animals. They are not aware \nof the gruesomeness but the parents feed them their beloved animals. They \nhide the truth and that's why so many people become ignorant und do not \nthink about what they consume. They learnt to just eat and drink, no matter \nwhere it comes from and no matter what is in it, they learnt to adapt to \nthe society which is ruled by the industry. They learnt to be a victim of \nnowadays' omnipresent cruelty. Mankind :)"

aS'Well said'
p889
aS'I prefer animals over humans Yeah...:) Still, good point'
p890
aS"Being a vegan doesn't really do much... I see it just as a self \nempowerment... All food you find in the supermarket is already pre- \nslaughtered so not eating it won't save anything it will only send a very \nslight message to the manufacturer that less produce is needed. So they \nwill continue the same process exactly the same way, but they may perhaps \nprolong the slaughter , killing them at a later date. IMHO being a vegan is \njust an act to make yourself feel better."
p891
aS'I meant that the concept of eating animals is a good thing. Not \nexcessively, but in a balanced way. And besides, farmers raise these \nanimals, so there is always more where that came from. Its not like meat \nfactories are causing species of animals to become extinct (unlike things \nlike the illegal act of elephant poaching; where criminals will kill \nanimals for ivory and not give back to said animal, causing the species to \nbecome endangered).'
p892
aS'Also, I\'d like to say that these discussions are not "useless". In fact, \nit\'s debates like these which allow us to expand our understanding of the \nworld around us and rethink our methods of trying to comprehend it.'

p903
aS'Ryan*'
p904
aS'Yes. Crocodiles, lions, bears and tigers all serve a much greater purpose \nfor the ecosystem that they live in than any human ever will. All of those \nanimals are more important than any human ever. Just because an animal is \nstronger than a human doesnt make the human the victim... After all, tigers \nare all but extinct because of humans right now. So... who is the real \nkiller here?'

aS'i would pull away a doggy more then a person'
p906
aS'1:40LOL'
p907
aS"That's not entirely true whatsoever. Just because animal mourning is often \nundetectable to the human eye, simply because it is not usually expressed \nin physical, exaggerated forms, does not prove the fact that humans mourn \nover their loved ones more than any other species. So, no, it is not true, \nand no, it is not undeniable. "

p924
aS'what type of dog do you have rayan?'
p925
aS"That's messed up"
p926
aS'Anna.. your comment is inaccurate. The dodo bird died off from being \novereaten and introduced populations ate their eggs. However this happened \nin the 1400s. Animals domesticated have not nor been close to dying off. \nBut I believe this argument is more about over mistreatment over animals we \neat and etc'
p927
aS'yes but if less people buy the meat products, the less the companies earn \nand the less meat they will kill. and if no one buys meat, the companies \nwont sell them, aka wont kill any animals. and yes, a few vegans wont \nchange much but u have to start somewhere or else no one will. :) im not \neven vegan though...maybe i should be haha'

aS'I respect Ryan but the weird thing with me is if a person died in a movie \nim just chill but if a dog died in a movie i would be so mad. Well thats \nbecause the humans have already lived their life and they knew what they \nwere doing but the animal is innocent and has no control over his life and \njust obeys his master.

p948
aS"... I have to say, I really like meat. I mean, if I got some meat and \nneeded to cook it, I wouldn't be thinking about the animal and the \nsuffering it went through. Hell, I wouldn't particularly care about the \nmethods used to kill it. The only thing on my mind is: MEAT! GIVE IT TO ME! \nMEAT! Well, mostly. Anyway, I'm an omnivore, like a lot of people out \nthere, Hate me if you will but I won't change my opinion."

aS'Shut up with you\'re fake "God"'
p951
aS"You know that not all humans are like that. There are people who think the \nsame way as you do and there are those that think the same way as that \nother person. It's just about their beliefs and morals. Rather than tell \nthem that you see an animal as being more valuable and important than them. \nSo if you really think about it, you are kind of the one in more wrong. You \nknow how your words can be interpreted. Please think before you type."
p952
aS'Hahaha lol'
p953
aS'My grandma eat,kill and torture animals xD '

aS"and why can't I love animals and accept that meat eaters have rights? Just \nbecause you say so? NO! May I ask, are you a teenager? Because Adults don't \ntalk like you. The way you talk clearly states that it's not that you \nhaven't accepted reality, it's that you WON'T accept reality. Teenagers are \noften the ones that deny and won't accept reality itself.

p981
aS'I\'ve hunted and killed deer, helped skin them, and cut out the meat.

However, if someone will eat it, I see nothing \nwrong with killing/slaughtering an animal for food. '

I\'m not saying veganism is wrong, I just think \nthat vegans like the ones below shouldn\'t be such jerks about it. there\'s \nnothing wrong with eating meat. I understand that animals have to be killed \nbut that\'s just life. and animals aren\'t "tortured" they are usually shot \n(head shot) or decapitated which instantly kills them. killing animals for \nfood isn\'t as bad as you say it is.'
p994
aS"Well, how is eating meat raw or cooked have to do with natural? People cook \nmeat because you get more nutrients and vitamins as well as having a better \ntime digesting it, but all that is still natural. We also discard certain \nparts because we can't eat it, like crab gills. If a tiger could season and \ncook its meat, he would also. But they haven't discovered fire or have \nopposable thumbs, do they? My response is not meant to offend or hurt \nanyone, but to merely state my opinion in a docile way."

p1025
aS"Being a vegetarian saves many lives of other animals. If you don't support \nthe people who kill the animals, then they will eventually have to stop \nkilling as many.

p1057
aS"I personally LOVE meat... and therefore am not a vegan/vegetarian, though I \nam also an animal lover at the same time. But a friend of mine was actually \nforced by her mom to be a vegan. Lucky for her, her parents are divorced \n(well not really...), so she can eat like a vegetarian over there. It's \nkind of funny, she wanted to have her birthday party at her dad's house so \nthat she could have ice cream! Even then, it's still kind of sad because \nnow she doesn't like the taste of meat at all. "

Tell me since when has man become righteous by becoming a vegan. Do \nu think by doing this u are better than everybody else? Quit whining and \nscreaming at people when it does no good. We don't see u as an incredibly \nsmart and awesome guy because you are vegan (at least I don't) I just see u \nas a person who is unhappy about his life"

p1069
aS'Wut the fuk dude save both dik'
p1070
aS"Depends where you live. Most humans eat livestock meat including pigs cows \nand chickens which are all animals that wouldn't actually live in the wild. \nWe eat domestic livestock for the most part, so it has nothing to do with \nkeeping populations down. It's different for things like wolves hunting \ndeer, then you would be right. But its not like that for us since the \nthings we're eating, even things like fish and deer (there are tons of fish \nfarms and deer farms), are all domesticated."

aS"Get over killing animals? Wow. You can't love animals if you're willing to \nkill them! And you DON'T need meat, sure you need protein but you can get \nthat from HEALTHIER choices... i mean meat might have protein but it also \nhas a lot of bad stuff too (ex cholesterol!) and milking cows is just \nweird. i mean imagine a cow drinking from your moms breasts! I don't think \nmilking the cow is bad.. it's just the torture and cruelty the put the cows \nthrough at dairy farms. You can live healthy w/o meat."

Also, we use our intelligence to make \nweapons to kill not prey or food sources, no we make nukes and start \nkilling each other. So you're right, a non-human could never do what a \nhuman could. You're actually proving my point about people. "
p1097

p1125
aS"I don't have a problem with people eating animals. Go shoot yourself a \ndeer, raise a cow or pig or some chickens on a farm , let them eat a normal \nfarm animal life, then slaughter them quickly and eat them. Or at least \nmake the minimal effort to make sure the meat you buy was raised humanely \nand healthy. You are ignorant if you think thats how the meat you buy in \nthose neat little packages was raised. Its not ok to subject them to a life \nof misery so you can stuff your face. Get a clue."

aS"Humans always seem to put ourselves on pedestals and believe that we are \nthe only sentient beings with the ability to mourn over loved ones - a \nhighly skewed view. In fact, elephants are one of the most social animals \non this planet - they thrive in community. When an elephant in their midst \ndies, they mourn. Same with us. After all, we ARE animals. Don't think that \nI am undervaluing your grief, I'm simply saying that there is no need to \ntake another life, period. No matter the species. "
p1166
aS"Humans are different from lions. We have the intelligence to season it. \nHowever, (I'm not a zoologist but this is from my perspective) I think \nlions and other WILD animals have some kind of different body system or \nsomething that allows them to eat raw. "

I don't know if you got scarred for that or you just found some \ninfo about eating meat (which you only focused on the negative and not the \npositives) which suddenly made you go on a vegan preaching rampage."
p1174
aS"so how about the insects that get killed by accident, aren't they valuable. \nPlease don't lie, I know you tried to kill a spider when you were a kid, if \nyou never did it then good for you. I like plants is also an opinion good \nsir. Cellulose is a type of veggie sugar that humans can't digest, only \nsome humans can but not most. So I think that most of us can't survive on \nplant based diets alone. Apparently having a different opinion equals to me \nwanting to eat babies? *facepalm* ayayay *smh*"

aS'haha yeah '
p1176
aS"I didn't say vegans were mean I love vegans...not you though, you're mean. \nAnd like I said when you messaged me being vegan doesn't work for me sorry. \nI have given up meat before, I only lasted 5 days before I blacked \nout...twice.

Btw I was doing that for lent but instead \ndid video games since I hadn't played them that week anyway."

p1178
aS"just shrug off the straw man and I'll be on my way"
p1179
aS"wow, you're guilty of the straw man argument here. Meat is legal, it's not \nillegal. Cannibalism is illegal, so you're argument is invalid"

p1182
aS"for you and me, but a lot of people have gotten sick because they forced \nthemselves on a vegan diet. We just have different genetics, some people \nsurvive on just plant-based diets, and other don't. Just accept it, not \neveryone on Earth is the same, it's life"

aS"please tell us exactly how you even found out he is torturing animals? \nAgain, please don't assume that everyone here is a meat eater, for all we \nknow, he might be a vegan himself"
p1184
aS"But then again... Eating non meat and plants and stuff... Thats taking away \nthe animals food and tons of animals eat some same things.. So kill one \nanimal to eat, Your not eating what they eat and much more live. If your \nreading this you probably think I am stupid but just think about it..

p1204
aS'But, do you realize that animals are eaten by other animals, which we are?'
p1205
aS"Yeah, we're highly developed apes, but we're still apes. Animals don't need \nto cook food because they can otherwise handle bacteria. They didn't need \nevolution to allow their brain to learn how to cook. Animals have their own \nprimitive forms of communication, but again they don't require full \nlanguages. So evolution hasn't given them languages. For such an animal \nlover you don't seem to give them much credit. We're animals, just more \ndeveloped. Do they teach you biology in school where u are?"
p1206
aS'I promise I am a vegan'

aS"The animals aren't tortured, they're quickly killed. Only somebody that's \nheartless will torture the animals before killing them. If meat isn't food, \nthen many people wouldn't be eating it.

aS"I love animals, but you accusing me of saying I hate animals is \ndisrespectful. Why would I even have a picture of a dog and a cat playing \nif I hate animals?

You hate people who eat \nmeat, which means you hate children, elderly and sick people who eat meat. \nAll I know is you pushing your beliefs down people's throats won't change \nany opinions, and it will make people hate you"
p1238
aS'Meat and dairy eating is the least natural thing to do also. Have you ever \nseen a baby kill an animal? As a baby we would scream and cry if an animal \nwas hurt in front of us but we grow up eating meat and our natural \ninstincts are completely suppressed into a cultural jail. Humans are gentle \nherbivores! Be kind and compassionate as you were meant to be!

So everything is possible, there is no question in \ntaste anymore, also not in health. You can eat unhealthy as a vegan and a \nmeat eater, also you can live healthy. I would google it because it's \nproven that vegan is healthier. The only question left is: Do I let kill \nfor food or do I use alternatives just as tasty."

p1320
aS"Animals are even less peaceful, so yeah, we're higher. True enlightenment \nis peace? Good. Try being peaceful then. Saying the people you're talking \nto are worth less than animals and verbally attacking their families are \nthe opposite of peace. Anger and hate are the opposite of peace. I'll give \nyou one thing: you're proving that some people aren't any more capable of \nenlightenment than animals.

p1417
aS'I would save the dog actually'
p1418
aS"That is asking philosophical questions, that has nothing to do with \nawareness of one's self. The comparison isn't flawed because children are \nstill human, aren't they? It isn't always true that animals chose \nthemselves, primates are an example. Some primates put the survival of \ntheir 'pack' in front of themselves. Granted it could be argued that that \nis just instinctive. But still that has nothing to do with why they don't \nhave souls. And you still haven't explained why we're higher beings..."

p1428
aS'i love my dog'
p1429
aS"So I used the term incorrectly, my point is still valid. So what, you're \nasking if babies have souls, why not animals? The answer is that babies are \nnot *physically* fully formed yet, but they're still human, therefore have \nsouls. An animal's mind will never get beyond the level of a human baby. I \nsaid twice now that having a soul makes us higher beings. You may not have \nunderstood, but I did explain it. I could go into the religious reasons, \nbut something tells me you won't count them as valid."

I suppose I can't expect people who don't believe in the \nsoul to accept that, but even going by the argument that we're animals, if \nanything that's a reason why we should eat other ones. We're the top of \nmany food chains. It's only natural for us, being on top, to eat the lower \nanimals. It's against nature to not eat meat. Not that there's anything \nwrong with that, but it's certainly not wrong to eat it either."

aS'vegans are terrible they eat the animals food '
p1457
aS'The fact is we are all alive, and have the same right to be living in \nearth.Why are we gonna decide about another life? Just live your life, eat \nwhen your body neeeds to eat, be kind, respect the others. Theres no \nneccesary to kill them if you dont have to. Its necesary when its REALLY \nneccesary, like times ago when alll was freeze, and humans needs to survive \neat them. Now eat them is full commerce.

p1472
aS"Why did the meat-freak eat all the animals so many more plants will die, \nthen if he just ate some vegetables? Producing meat requires many more \nplants. Get your facts right. You're imbarrasing to the human race."
p1473
aS'word'
p1474
aS"idk what kinds of food you feed your herds , but here we have Animal \nFodders made of agricultural leftovers. so they actually save the \nenvironment instead of making these go to waste , also animal manure serves \nwell as compost for plants. as for pain , what makes you so sure? even \nmicrobes can run away , invent tactics and fight , and logically feel pain \n, and you think just because plants are deprived from moving that they \ndon't feel pain?"

p1517
aS"vegans logic , animals > humans > plants if so , they should just throw \nthemselves to hungry hyenas.

Also, if you were to kill an animal such as a tiger, the \ncubs would be killed because they wouldn't be able to take care of \nthemselves, just like a human child.

p1594
aS"Completely false. Many people would get malnourished and die without meat. \nOnly some people can be vegan and stay healthy. I'm all for treating \nanimals well, but I'm also all for killing them humanely and eating them. "

aS'how many post do u have to make?'
p1596
aS'insects killed by accident? ACCIDENT. Youre meat is being tortured and \nkilled on PURPOSE you idiot.'

aS'I find it cruel. You see, why not do this: yell really loud "STOP!!!!!!"'
p1598
aS"There are many reasons why I know we have souls. But I'm not up for a big \ndebate now, and the human soul is a vast subject that we can't fully \ncomprehend, and therefore would take far longer than the time (and \ncharacters) I have to explain."

aS"Dear Ryan how can u talk that fast???? Wow!! Jaja I've got 4 dogs and I \nlove them!! Animals are so much better than people u.u funny video!"
p1600
aS'lol exactly!! Veganism ftw.'
p1601
aS' I really wish that, though animals are wonderful creatures, that you see \nhumans are equally as important and valuable.***'

p1603
aS'intelligence is different than a conscious.'
p1604
aS"ferrets are carnivores though. vegetation is bad for them and their \ndigestion. even if cats eat grass, they will still choose to hunt and eat \nother animals. that's the way life has been, and always will be about. \nPredatory animals are designed specifically to kill other animals, while \nherbivores are designed to pay attention to their surroundings to avoid \npredators and eat vegetation."
p1605
aS'Lmfao! His face when he wanted to run the person over after he killed the \n"dog!" Hahaha so funny'
p1606
aS"And anyway, Veagans obviously don't value the lives of plants and they eat \nplants which are living organisms but because they are less self aware than \nus they eat plants. That's the same with carnivores."
p1607
aS'Humans are animals too dude.'
p1608
aS"Just because someone defends or supports meat-eaters does not mean they \nencourage people to go and consume dead animals. Eating meat is natural \neven if you don't like it."
p1609
aS'Maybe because for every 1 plant that a human puts in the ground, 100 more \nare chopped down by humans. Sorry but the bad heavily outweighs the good in \nthis one. Humans are literally KILLING the earth, and the only reason \nanyone is trying to save it now is because of fear for the human race, not \nbecause someone actually gives a shit about a subspecies of monkey that \njust got wiped out by deforestation. Humans are ALWAYS destructive and \nselfish. '
p1610
aS'good point indeed.'
p1611
aS'If you look at our ancient ancestors, we ate meat. We were programmed to \nhunt and kill. Once we switched to farming should have been the end of our \nomnivorous diets, however we need protein to live, and in some places \nprotein might have been hard to get if we only ate eggs and nuts to eat, \nthus the farming of livestock. Your response to my first comment has a good \npoint though.'

p1623
aS'Animals are very important just like humans are'
p1624
aS"Wow I actually didn't think about that until now"
p1625
aS"Yeah you're right it's better to let the animal die a slow miserable death, \neither from suffocation or bleeding out. And you're also right about not \nhaving farms, we should eat everything straight out of the wild, that way \nwe can let the population of these animals dwindle until they're \nextinct...I finally see the error of my ways.

p1638
aS"the difference between animals(pets) is that they don't judge and they \ndon't gurt people unless they're trained to be vicious or that's just there \nnature. overall in my opinion animals are muh better than humans"
p1639
aS"you are stupid. it does make you bad people because you are killing other \nanimals for your fat selfish mouth. Everything has to die, but don't you \nconsider the WAY they die? Animals didn't give themselves to us for us to \neat! It's unfair for them! Also, people in the animal farms abuse and \ntorture the animals! Maybe you should research before trying to say \nsomething."

aS"It's not an excuse, it's a fact lmao. meat eaters are trying to justify \nthat murder and cruelty to other animals is ok, while vegans is saying that \nit's wrong, so seriously? "
p1649
aS"do you really know how evolution works? Because, the way I see it is that \nthat's not emotion, that's instincts because fear of death and pain is just \na defensive reaction which is also included in instincts..."
p1650
aS"But humans aren't omnivores/carnivores: It's unnatural and you know why? \nBecause, when was the last time you saw a lion seasoning and cooking his \nmeat, discarding certain parts? Natural omnivores/carnivores eat their \nmeals raw and whole. If your system can't handle that, you weren't meant to \neat meat!"

aS'I would save the dog'
p1655
aS'Yes, why do you think vegans and vegetarians are so strong about their \nbeliefs? You could research it or look up a few videos, and you can see why \nwe vegans hate eating meat! Meat eaters try to say its good to eat meat and \nnot harmful but thats false.'

p1690
aS"Wow, I can see you have no intentions of making friends or accepting \nreality, please get out of the house and get some fresh air (possibly \ntherapy). Because I can see the stress has gone to your head. We shouldn't \ntolerate torture or killing for fun and it would be nice of there are more \nvegans but let's face reality here. Eating meat is not an issue. Animals in \nthe wild are left alone, when someone even in the slightest tries to hurt \nthem, they'd get jailed instantly"
p1691
aS'Yeah, but typically the animal eats the fruit and poops out the seeds. Pay \nattention, bro.'
p1692
aS'Why are you passivley killing them in an atrocious way?'
p1693
aS"Nature = God. Most humans naturally need meat to live healthy lives. So \nyeah, God kinda made it so. Now, close that account. Stop insulting people \nwith Jesus' name. :\\"

p1697
aS'Nope. Im with you on that one. I mean like, why are standing in the middle \nof the street? texting on your phone? not moving even if you hear the car? \nsigh...Society nowadays...'

p1700
aS"You people are fucking idiots. I live on a farm yes. But you didn't bother \nask how long it's been here. The answer is two centuries so my family, \nwhich is originally from Italy but I live in ireland, has never killed.

p1706
aS"I do stand up for what's right. I promote animals rights and I don't \nsupport torturing and animal abuse. BUT I still consider that meat eaters \nare people that have rights too. I think it's VERY wrong to torture and \nkill animals just for the heck of it, but farm animals aren't killed just \nfor that reason. They are killed to feed starving people around the world, \nthere are a lot of kids out there that eat meat, and if the world would \nfollow things as you wish, you're technically killing those kids"
p1707
aS"Part of the food chain? Maybe for NATURAL omnivores/carnivores, but humans \naren't meant to eat meat. i mean when was the last time you saw a tiger \nseason, cook, or discard parts of its meal? If your body can't stand eating \nthe WHOLE animal raw, then obviously it's not natural."
p1708
aS"I already thought of how much I LOVE animals. I LOVE animals. Here's some \nproof. My dad set a caterpillar on fire and I jumped on my dad and he \nalmost set me on fire. He won. I cried. Nothing's good D:"

aS"(Note: I'm an omnivore.) Whoah... animals eat EACH OTHER??? and we are \nmammals? Does that mean I have NIPPLES?!!? Why doesn't anyone tell me these \nthings? Okay but seriously, lions have to be fast enough to kill (at least) \nthe slowest antelope in a herd. The weak die; the strong survive ( that's \nthe circle of life). Now imagine if any adult lion could kill any antelope \nat any time (without even using much energy or time). Pretty soon the \ncircle will disintegrate. "
p1718
aS'it\'s quite obvious you\'re unintelligent, you don\'t have to say that. and \nwhat you "feel" is inhumane and illogical.

aS"No, English is not my first language, but that's irrelevant to the \nargument, I hope you still understood what I was trying to say. Now, of \ncourse I would save my family/friend, not because people are worth more \nthan animals but because my family/friend is, more than anybody else for \nme, as I would save a person close to me instead of 5 random persons. Now \nif I had to choose to save between 1 random person, and 5 dogs, I would \nsave the dogs. Sorry, but your argument is still dumb."
p1745
aS"WHY was this voted down? You people are idiots if you think I'm wrong. I \nwould literally die without meat, because my body can't get enough protein \nand minerals from plants. So, thanks for saying my life is worth less than \nthe animals I eat. You people are awesome. So very kind and respectful. You \nreally know how to make a person feel wanted and respected. I'm just going \nto go remind myself that those who voted my comment down are just idiots \nand don't actually think I'm worth less than animals."
p1746
aS"Well said. We are all vegan by instinct and at heart, we just need to wake \nthat part of us back up as it's been sleeping so long. Meat eaters fight \nfor the violence to continue because they simply haven't woken up yet. \nSometimes even the most violent of carnists become vegan, it just takes a \nlong time for most. I went vegan at eighteen and could never ever go back. \nI feel bad about the animals I ate prior, I wish we weren't being taught to \nbe carnists at home and at school and by this society! "
p1747
aS"I understand your situation but you can't say that an animal doesn't have \nrelations like that, you know? I mean if you think out of the Box, yes \nHumans are more complex to Family and such relations But so are animals, \nthey just tend to not take it as serious as humans do...Anyway In MY \nopinion I think there are to many Humans on the world...which most of them \nare douche-bags anyway (not saying You or anyone here is)"

How do you know that animals don't \nempathize? or wonder about the universe? or that we have emotions that they \ndon't? Look at children. When born they don't empathize. It's also been \nproven that they don't understand that there is more knowledge than that of \nwhich they know, they don't wonder about things until about age 5"

IF I want to listen to the other party\'s \nopinion, they damn better give me an opinion that doesn\'t say anything like \nwhat I stated in my previous sentence. What am I suppose to shoot back at \nyou? Ask you to eat rocks and save food for animals? This isn\'t even an \nargument, it\'s more like a fight with a bible thumper.'
p1765
aS"Cows and chickens only flourish because we eat them. If elephants and \ntigers were eaten more often then they would be flourishing. This is \nbecause we would be breeding them so we'd have more food to eat. Cats and \ndogs flourish because they have small heads with big eyes which causes \nhumans to like them.

I told her that we shouldn't support \nslaughtering animals. a woman behind me then suddenly said: I eat meat! \nlike, why should i stop eating meat! I LOVE it! confused as I was, I told \nher: yeah, that's nice o.o I don't care."

p1771
aS"yea i call bullshit on that. No one's obnoxiously coming up to you and \ndemonizing you for being a vegan while preaching about how great eating \nmeat is. And besides, vegans on make up less than maybe 1 % of the \npopulation. Deal with it. I have no problems with vegans. I admire them \nactually! I just hate those preachy, self righteous, I'm better than you \nvegans. "
p1772
aS"No, I have never said that those who eat meat are unpleasant people, stop \ntrying to tell me what I said, son, and never have I said vegans or \nvegetarians were better than the others. You have no substantive arguments \nso you've decided to distort my opinion. I don't have any more time to \nwaste for such a party in discussion. What do you think happens in other \ncountries? Animals commit suicide so that people can get meat? Grow up and \nwake up, son, because for now you're full of shit. Sorry. Cya :)"

Not all countries slaughter.) \nIt's not blind denial, it's what we do. So what? Being a vegetarian or \nvegan, you guys should look out for your own asses rather than poking your \nnose into other people's business and start saying crap like that. \nSeriously, stop acting like some superior race like feminists."

aS"Well. I'm not a vegan but it's not actually necessary for people to eat \nmeat.

p1889
aS'oh, and i suppose that means that you never watch TV? and anyways, the \ncomment you posted changed no ones minds about eating meat. all you got was \na bunch of "negative votes". i mean, i love animals, but not eating meat \nwon\'t make the animals survive longer. and no, we are not "destroying" the \nplanet. its not like were making every single species endangered or \nanything. although i do think that people should kill the endangered \nanimals.

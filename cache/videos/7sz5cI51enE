aS'What song is that'
p157
aS'-.- do u seriously not know context. Ryan has mentioned kpop before, did it \never cross your mind when he said "I have no idea what i\'m watching" maybe \nbecause the MV he was watching was colourful and confusing? He even \ndescribed kpop as being "bright colours,dancing and stuff I don\'t \nunderstand" Even if 1.maybe he doesn\'t like kpop anymore 2.maybe he ONLY \nlikes 2NE1 3.maybe u should live with the fact that no everyone will love \nkpop. with fans like this, no surprise if he didn\'t want 2 b 1'

p902
aS'ummm before the finebro\'s even asked the rest of the youtubers what kind of \nmusic they liked, ryan was the 1st person to say it was kpop. Liking one \ngroup does not mean liking "kpop". Back in 2007 for 5 months I only \nlistened to SNSD, doesn\'t mean I liked or even knew what kpop was. Just \nbecause he likes 2NE1 doesn\'t mean he likes kpop, no different than just \nbecause someone likes PSY doesn\'t mean they like kpop. That\'s why he called \nhimself a "2NE1" fan.'

DONT BULLY BECAUSE YOU MAKE PEOPLE HATE YOU. \nBUT SAY ALL YOU WANT TO THE PEOPLE YOU BULLY BUT THEY WON'T LISTEN TO YOU \nBECAUSE YOU DONT KNOW THEM VERY WELL.

aS"I was once suicidal and depressed. Had no real friends, I got bullied, all \nthat jazz. I started to feel so depressed, I wouldn't do my homework cause \nI just didn't see the point in it. I didn't see the point in life. And \nyeah, I did realize that I had to be funny to survive and gain friends and \nstuff. At first it was difficult and I could never think of anything funny \nto say. But as I worked on it, funny stuff just kinda slips outta my mouth. \nEven during class... speaking of class, I still didn't do much of my \nhomework and my parents would yell at me for it which would make me more \ndepressed. Then I had enough. Finally my thoughts of suicide turned into \nplans and I even set a date for when I would do it. But I didn't, because \njust when I was about to, I suddenly saw meaning, and I don't know what \nfrom. Highschool eventually started and the first day was awful. I hated \neveryone and everything. But I kept being as funny as possible. When lunch \nstarted, I didn't know what to do. I had no friends to hang out with. Until \none of my acquaintances showed up and we started talking. He introduced me \nto his friend group and we walked up to the gas station. We all talked and \nhad a good time. I guess I made a good impression. I hung out with those \nguys everyday and eventually I finally met the dude who would become my \nbest friend. I had known him since 3rd grade, but we never really talked to \nmuch until now. He's pretty much the smartest dude in the whole school. He \nalways talks about fun facts and sciencey mumbo jumbo. But it was really \ninteresting. Just knowing how complex and amazing the world was made the \nthoughts of hatred fade away. I started doing my homework again, and I was \nespecially interested in the science homework. I started learning about \nneurobiology. (Study of the brain) and I was so fascinated. I learned how \nrare a consciousness how lucky I was to have such an advanced, complex, \nhuman consciousness. (Which lead me to atheism, but whatever. It made me \nwiser) After the change, I wanted to know everything. Science was the \ngreatest thing ever to me. I started learning about evolutionary biology \nand thats what struck me. I loved the process. It was the most fascinating \nthing ever. Evolution was just so complex and amazing. Now I realized just \nhow rare and unique I, and everyone alive, really were. Which lead me to \nfind my amazing girlfriend who loves science just as much as I do. Now I \nlive life happily, knowing that I am such a fascinating creature. Whats \nmore, I know that Im smarter then most of the people who try to bully me. \nWhen they say something awful, my newly found confidence allowed me to make \na comeback. When they tried to injure me, my newly found confidence lead me \nto dodge and strike back. Nobody bullies me anymore and the guys who were \nonce my bullies were now my friends. So to all of you suffering from \ndepression just know that it does get better. I wouldn't believe myself if \nI hadnt witnessed such a process myself; and to all of you who don't think \nthat the world has any meaning, a little knowledge can change that view. \nThe world is a complex, beautiful place that you are lucky to be able to \nexperience at such a high level of consciousness. And whats more, is that \nthere are more worlds then this that are even more fascinating. Ignorance \ncan severely damage your confidence, but a little knowledge is all that is \nneeded to destroy any feelings of doubt about your existence.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I\'m like you.. I was bullied in highschool AND college! I didn\'t have \nfriends or I lost some friends because they found new friends and because I \nseparated myself from "friends" which were bullies and brought me down. I \nwas silent and didn\'t talk unless spoken to in highschool. When I was in \n3rd and 4th year high I made very good friends with two 1st year girls and \none girl who was the younger sister of my classmate and one year level \nbelow me. Everyone in highschool knew that I was being bullied and they \nwould see the bullying happen sometimes when almost all my classmates would \nlaugh at me in front of so many students in our school yard. I wanted to \nmake friends with one of my classmates but they would all avoid me because \nthey worried about what other people will think or they just didn\'t feel \nlike making friends with a loser. I think it was 3rd year high when a group \nof my classmates bullied and laughed at me in front of other year levels to \nthe point that I was about to cry because of the pain and the embarrassment \n. Because of that I separated myself from the group and made a choice to \nnot have friends instead of having "friends" that put you down. I didn\'t \neat during break time or lunch time because everybody else would go out \ntogether and I was afraid that people would see me alone eating so I \nstarved myself. I think in 4th year I tried to eat during lunch but I \nremember waiting for everybody else to go out so there would be less people \nwho would see me walk alone and I remember hiding in my eating place or \nwhere I bought food or or even in the library so that people wouldn\'t see \nme alone. Highschool was one of the most difficult times in my life and one \nof the most depressing but I made very good friends who I can call real \nfriends and who I laughed with a lot and had a 3rd year highschool best \nfriend who would advice me a lot about life and who would listen to \neverything that I said and even my secrets and listen especially when I was \nin tears and sobbing and hopeless.\n\nI changed myself and made it a point in college to make lots of friends and \nhave fun because I want to escape my highschool years. My first years in \ncollege were fine and so much fun but then when 2nd year came (I think), I \nwas alone again because I got separated from my friends who were in \ndifferent sections or somewhere and I separated myself from the crowd \nagain. I don\'t know how the bullying started. I became a weirdo to them and \nchose to be true to myself and not make friends with hypocrites, plastics \nand bullies like what I did in highschool. I also made extraordinary and \nout of the ordinary fashion choices because I was so in love with fashion \nat that time and I was so inspired because of Final Fantasy\'s fashion and \nbecause of my love for RPGs. I was so inspired one time because of Tidus so \nI came to school with a huge belt wrapped around my leg!! But my older \nbrother hated me for it and thought I was looking for attention but later \non in our lives he learnt to accept and appreciate that side of me. And I \ncontinued to do so even though other people were laughing, mocking or \njudging me for how I look but I was beaming with confidence and some people \nwere praising me also for being brave and being awed at how modern I look. \nDidn\'t deal with physical assaults like you did but the emotional impact it \nhad on me especially highschool made me think at one time when I had a \nfight with my mom to commit suicide also \'cause I kept on fighting with my \nmom during highschool. In college it\'s like I convinced myself to not care \nabout what other people think even if people see me alone and ultimately to \nfollow my heart\'s desire... in this case, FASHION! I decided to be brave \nand to stand by my decision of being alone. I\'m still different now or \nconsider myself to be because of how much I want to be true to myself and \nto always be happy with what I am and what I\'m doing. I still avoid or \nignore people that are bullies or have bad attitudes.. now my workmates. \nUnlike in highschool when I would just let people bully me without saying \nanything AT ALL!, in college I learnt to fight back with words and defend \nmyself and I became like my mom who stoods up for herself EVERYTIME!! \n(because she said she was bullied too before!) I took everything positively \nin my life and not became passive and not confident unlike my older brother \nunfortunately, who was bullied too in highschool and some of his college \nyears. But since we immigrated to Canada, he has changed some of his \nattitudes and thinking so that\'s good! I learnt a lot from these \nexperiences and from my break up experiences with my first and last \nboyfriend. I also dealt with family or family relative favoritism and \ndiscouragement and of course I wasn\'t the favorite one or I was the least \nliked one. I became so mature because of these and although the break up \nstill makes me think that it would\'ve been better if I didn\'t have a \nboyfriend (because he also stole one year worth of work savings from me), I \nstill thank my experiences \'cause I wouldn\'t be the person that I am right \nnow if not for those. And right now, I\'m still dealing with my OCD since \nhighschool actually and hopefully it ends soon so I can live my life to the \nfullest! :)\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I think you overstated your point during that first half. It's one thing to \nsay that other types of bullying should be focused on. But when you go as \nfar as to say that cyber bullying isn't really that bad and you can get out \nof it so easily (not exact phrasing of course), then that's going too far.\nYou can stop someone from writing to you online or something like that by \nblocking them (although they could make another account). But cyber \nbullying tends to be more when someone is humiliated online, which is \npublic. I's not as simple as, it's not direct therefore it's fine. On one \nhand, sure, it's not physical abuse, and the bullies aren't right next to \nyou. But on the other hand online is something that lasts. As opposed to \none in person act which lasts a minor amount of time.\nAlso, someone should not have to delete their account to escape being \nbullied. And saying they shouldn't be online if they can't handle it... \nthat's just wrong. That is blaming the victim.\n\nAnd then, it's one thing to say that you should focus on helping people \ndeal with bullying. But you go as far as to condone it. Acting like it's a \npart of life and it's a good thing.\xef\xbb\xbf"

My bullying didn\'t go as far as physical \nbulling but by doing what I\'m doing things start to get better when I\'m on \n3rd grade, people start noticing me, there are people who still cares for \nme a lot, when someone being mean to me they are going to defend me like \n"stop it, do you want to be the one like her" or just comforting me, so \nyeah, I\'m still typing this haha and fyi I manafe to get through my high \nschool years and in fact when I almost finish my year our teacher asked us \nto write a letter to each others and ends up most of my bullies apologize \nto me and try to be friends with me, and I\'m in collage now and I\'m trying \nto not be bullied in collage and untill this far I manage to do that, what \nyou need to do is chill, being friendly (but not to friendly that would be \ncreepy) and spread your knowledge so you have something to talk to so they \nwon\'t think you are a (sorry) freak that can\'t be talked with, anyway I \ndidn\'t even realize I could type this much about my bulling life and what a \nrelief to finnaly be able to let this thing of my chest because I didn\'t \ntell anyone about my bullying life even my parents and sister, well that\'s \nfrom me hehehe hope this inspire you readers, piss out yo (I know I\'m \nweird) and thank you so much to this nigahiga vieo that voice out also my \nopinion of bullying hillariously\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I don\'t agree with anyone who says it\'s the victim\'s fault. It\'s never the \nfault of the victim. I\'ve been cyber bullied. I did block the girl who did \nit and stop talking to her altogether. That didn\'t even help because \nseveral friends of hers bullied me, too. She started bullying me in real \nlife and it wasn\'t my fault, it was theirs. Also, I know that some people \nneed social media. That\'s all I have to talk to the closest thing I have to \nfamily and I\'m never giving up my Facebook or Twitter accounts because I \nneed them. This is just my opinion, but social media is extremely important \nin our lives, no matter how "first world" it is. It helps us connect with \npeople so much more easily. Cyber bullying can be just as important as \n"IRL" bullying because for the people who need social media, it can make it \nso that you\'re scared to talk to the people you love and care about and it \ncan make you scared to live your everyday life. That\'s what it did to me \nand I\'m still being bullied. Sometimes, not being bullied is a little \nharder than the click of a button. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"Hay I think your right. My dad got beat up and heavily bullied at school \nand has now become a gr8 man and a true inspiration to me. I have also been \nbullied at school but in a different way the one where they exclude you, \nfriends backstab you and teachers do nothing. I spent year1 with friends \nthat constantly ditched me, and being called ugly, my only true friends \nwere guys. My parents didn't like that and I changed schools and repeated \nyear 1. I had no true friends for the entire year and I mostly sat at \nrecess and lunch by myself. Year 2 wasn't much different I had a crush on a \nguy that was kind and mature beyond his age. year 3 I had 1 friend not a \ntrue friend yet and a lot of head on bullying with girls that out right \nhated me and told me so then told the teachers we were friends and acted \nlike I was the villain just because I refused to cry. Year 4 a guy picked \non me continuously and kept humiliating me in front of the entire class I \ngot sick of it and kicked him in the balls. Then behind my back my friends \nstole my hair brush and tried to flush it down the toilet, ripped up my \nnotebook and destroyed the musical instrument I played. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why \nbut I forgave them straight away they didn't even have to ask. They were \ntrue friends after that. I didn't get bullied again till year 7 and I was \nexcluded, backstabbed by friends again, called ugly and told that I sounded \nlike nails on a chalk board. Year 8 I had no friend at all again for half \nthe year then I made a friend then made 3 more until they all started \nhating each other and we all split up. And I\xe2\x80\x99m now in year 9 and my bulling \nhas stopped. I have found true friends and a loving bf. who I have been \ngoing out with for 7 months :D and to be honest I'd also like to thank all \nmy bullies because without them I wouldn't be the caring headstrong person \nI am now.

aS'I agree, I was also bullied. I am in high school. From first grade till \neighth grade I was bullied. Not only by students but because of my \ndisabilities. I have Autism, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, ADD, and ADHD. I was \ncalled weird, retarded, stupid, different, idiotic, bitch and more by \nstudents. Because of my Autism parents would physically shove me away from \ntheir kids like I was gonna hurt them or I was contagious. My teachers told \nmy parents that I would never be able to learn normally like everyone else \nso I was thrown in special ed classes...I was rarely physically abused, but \nit did happen. People always told me "They are just words, get over it." \nWell guess what? Its hard to get over when everyone hates you because of \nsomething you have no control over. I wish my teachers cared that I was \nbeing bullied. I stopped telling them I was being bullied because they \ndidn\'t do anything, my mom tried so hard to help me but she couldn\'t stop \nit either. I\'ve changed schools so many timed but not because I was being \nbullied (my mom likes moving around but not so much anymore thank god). I \nhonestly, I\'m gonna be honest and I know some people might think I\'m being \ndramatic or lying but I can swear to you that I am not, did end up doing \nself harm. I almost tried to kill myself but a friend found out and stopped \nme. I wish I had stood up to my bullies but at the time I was that shy kid \nin the corner..so I just took it..I wish I had stood up to them.

aS'So, this video is old by now, but I feel like I need to put out my opinion \non cyber-bullying.\n\nI kinda disagree with the fact that cyber-bullying can be escaped by simply \nblocking/unfriending bullies or just staying away from social media in \ngeneral. It\'s true that it practically eliminates DIRECT forms of bullying \n(such as name calling or comments that try to hurt you). But I feel that a \nresistance against that kind bullying can easily be built up. The internet \nis only half friendly (that varies a LOT depending on where you are in the \ninternet though lol) so if you spend time on the net, you\'re sure to come \nin contact with rather nasty people and that\'s something that you should \nget used to. Some people just hate others and not everyone you meet will \nlike you. They\'re just randoms after all, they don\'t know you in real life.\n\nBut the problematic part of cyber-bullying is that the bullies AREN\'T just \nrandoms on the internet. It\'s the ones who know you in person who are the \nworst to deal with. Ryan mentioned that you can\'t escape from bullying if \nyou\'re forced to confront it. Cyber-bullying is no different. You will \ndefinitely experience the effects at school or work.\nThe shocking thing about cyber-bullying is how QUICKLY and EASILY it can \noccur without anyone\'s knowledge. They are able to affect what goes on in \nyour life, even if you aren\'t aware of it. They can easily shame you and \nENCOURAGE VIOLENCE and HATE against you through social media. Amanda Todd\'s \ncase is a sad (but extreme) example.\n\nCyber-bullying is the same as "normal" bullying, but through a different \nmedia. :(\n\nApart from that, I agree a lot with what Ryan is saying. I also feel \nbullying is a part of society that will never go away. What campaigns do is \nraise AWARENESS and I feel that is one of the most essential things to do \nto support victims of bullying. Some bullies might not realize how much \npain they might be causing others (accidental bullies). Awareness also \ngives people the chance to support victims who are in need of help by \nhelping them IDENTIFY the bullies and the victims.

aS'Dear Ryan, I do appreciate your opinion on the cyber bullying. And i am a \nvictim of online and real life bullying. I would like to clear some things \nup for you, if I may. So called \'Cyber bullying\' is thought to be things \nsaid just to you but if you post something to every one about someone then \npeople will act on this. Since i understand that this is unclear let me \ngive a small example of this:\nSomeone posts: "Samantha is s***. She slept with John." people will treat \nyou awfully on your everyday life. You of a people should understand \nsomething said like this, true or not, will get people to bully you. And it \nis painful to be afraid to go to school everyday. I go to school knowing I \nWILL be picked on. I WILL get things thrown at me. I WILL get physically \nhurt and I WILL go home feeling like my life is worthless. I get the \nconfusion. I hope this cleared some stuff up for you. Please don\'t take \nthis as hate because I love your channel. Thank you for your time. I \nrealize this was such a small example but i am trying not to get flashbacks \nto everything from my personal experiences. I wish you all the best of \nluck. And if anyone ever needs anyone to talk to I am here fpr support. ;) \nhave a great life!\n(and yes I realize this probably won\'t be read by Ryan or mentioned in a \nvideo but I just wanted to clear the rep. It hurts when people say your \nbullying is nothing when it causes you depression) \xf0\x9f\x92\x97\xf0\x9f\x92\x97\xf0\x9f\x92\x97 Stay Strong!!!\xef\xbb\xbf'

Yes that type of bullying is scary and bad and definitely needs to \nwatched out for, we cannot let our ignorance of the suffering that cyber \nbullying causes blind us from acting on that.\n\nYes, maybe us older people who grew up just before cyber bullying became a \nproblem may not realize what it can do, but people have killed themselves \nfrom the suffering that it caused them. Ryan said that his bullies made him \nfeel isolated at school, cyber bullies are not just hater on youtube, they \nare people people who go to your school as well. If you are getting \nattacked online, I can imagine you definitely don't feel so included in \nperson.\n\nI am glad this is an unpopular opinion. I hope the campaigns continue to \nmake bullying become a taboo thing to be accused of. Including cyber \nbullying. A person should not be able to torment another person physically \nOR mentally.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'That\'s very true. I have a friend who I used to not like very much because \nhe would make Mexican jokes when I wasn\'t Mexican but I was Latino and as a \nkid it pissed me off a lot. But when you take away the joke from them by \nstealing their obvious pun like the "mow my lawn" jokes, then they don\'t \nhave a joke and they just give up lol. It starts funny when they realize \nyou have sense of humor. But then it kind of ruins the fun of them making \nfun of you if it\'s not hurting you. This usually happens with friends tbh \nbecause they think since you are their friend that they can make racist \njokes cause you can take a joke. It takes a whole but role with the punches \nand they get bored of their own lame unoriginal comedy. \n\nAnd if all else fails just tell them YOUR RACIST JOKES ARENT FUNNY.

aS"Unfortunately, teasing is often part of growing up \xe2\x80\x94 almost every child \nexperiences it. But it isn't always as innocuous as it seems. Words can \ncause pain. Teasing becomes bullying when it is repetitive or when there is \na conscious intent to hurt another child. It can be verbal bullying (making \nthreats, name-calling), psychological bullying (excluding children, \nspreading rumors), or physical bullying (hitting, pushing, taking a child's \npossessions).\n\nHow Bullying Starts\nBullying behavior is prevalent throughout the world and it cuts across \nsocio-economic, racial/ethnic, and cultural lines. Researchers estimate \nthat 20 to 30 percent of school-age children are involved in bullying \nincidents, as either perpetrators or victims. Bullying can begin as early \nas preschool and intensify during transitional stages, such as starting \nschool in 1st grade or going into middle school. \n\nVictims of bullying are often shy and tend to be physically weaker than \ntheir peers. They may also have low self-esteem and poor social skills, \nwhich makes it hard for them to stand up for themselves. Bullies consider \nthese children safe targets because they usually don't retaliate.\nression can last into adulthood and interfere with personal and \nprofessional lives. \n\nBullies are affected too, even into adulthood; they may have difficulty \nforming positive relationships. They are more apt to use tobacco and \nalcohol, and to be abusive spouses. Some studies have even found a \ncorrelation with later criminal activities. Bullying helps nobody not even \nyourself, if you're being bullied the best thing to do in your situation is \nto either get away from it (if possible), or tell an adult. Most adults \n(Principals, Teachers, Parents, etc.) will help you, if not well that is \nbullshit. So people of the internet, can you like not? :)\n#BULLYINGISNTGOINGAWAYSOLETSTEACHTHEKIDSHOWTODEALWITHBULLYINGANDOTHERSTUFF\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"I agree with you but I want to bring up that yes you have the option to \nescape it but sometimes it starts with social media and becomes a real life \neveryday in person thing.

Then if it isn't all \nthat bad delete whatever account block etc. but that thing that started \nwith cyber-bulling is now an everyday problem they have to face. I think \nthat people can be exploited on the internet in ways you can't in real life \nwhich is part of the problem of just bullying in general. So I do agree \nwith you but I think that they are bringing light particularly to cyber \nbullying because it could be the start of something that escalates to \neveryday problems you are confronted with whether physically or verbally, \nwhich make you the bad guy.

aS"The thing with cyber bullying is that it easily becomes more than just an \neasy-to-escape online thing.\nFirst of all, if you want to bully someone through a social media platform, \nthe victim don't necessarily have to be part of it. Someone I know has \nstill problems with bullying after.well, sort of intimate pictures of them, \nthat someone else took secretly, were published on facebook. They did not \nhave an account, mind you. The platform was just used as a tool to easily \nembarass someone quickly in front of many, many people, and it had very \nreal-life consequences that could not be escaped so easily.\n\nI know that you mean that when someone decides to put information about \nthem on the internet, they have to be prepared for trolls, bullies, etc. \nAnd if you don't want any more hateful youtube comments or rude anons on \ntumblr - f*ck'em, deal with it or delete your account. Yes, I totally agree \nwith you here. But that's not the entire range of cyber bullying. Sometimes \nyou can't help getting caught in it, facing consequences with out having \ntaken any action. \n\nWe can't just see internet and real life as something seperate. \nJust because something is essentially a bunch of binary numbers, it's not \nless real than the people in front of the screen. And definetly not less \nreal than the classmates you have to face every day after they saw pictures \nof you naked that someone else published on facebook.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'"Dealing" with cyber bullying doesn\'t always mean you\'re okay because you \ncan get away from it. First of all, if you\'re going to use Facebook as an \nexample, most of the people you friend on there are people you know in real \nlife, so you literally can be "backed into a corner" with them because they \ncan send you messages on there and still see you in real life. And a lot of \nthe fear with cyber bullying is that with new technology and such, people \ncan trace your ip address and figure out where you live. I get what Ryan\'s \nsaying when he\'s talking about it being your choice to go onto social media \nand that if you\'re bullied it\'s you\'re fault, but that is actually victim \nshaming. It\'s not someone\'s fault that they got bullied over social media \nbecause they chose to be there, that\'s the same as saying it\'s a woman\'s \nfault she got raped because she chose to wear a certain outfit. People \nshouldn\'t have to fear being on the Internet and emotional damage dealt \nfrom messages by people online is just that: damage. Coming from someone \nwho was bullied a lot in school as well, sometimes reading what people say, \neven if they don\'t know you, can be really hurtful and make you feel like \ncrap as well. So, no, I don\'t agree with this video, and I\'m not mad or \n"hating", and I still love Ryan, I\'m just stating my difference in opinion \nand explaining why I disagree.\xef\xbb\xbf'

And she \nwas bullied at school, too, because the kids at school saw the ridicule and \ndecided to join in. I guess if she was really desperate, she could've \nescaped, and you ARE right, there is no way we can stop bullying, but I \njust wanted to point out she wasn't able to escape HER bullies.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I agree with you only to some extent. I, too, was bullied in elementary \nschool to the point of developing memory blackouts. So I know bullying in \nreal life is much worse than words on a screen. Most cases of \ncyber-bullying are not that serious. However, there\'s always a point to \nwhich something becomes too much. Sure, some bullying is just words, but if \na bully sends especially graphic and explicit pictures (which often contain \nviruses, by the way) that\'s cyberbullying. There are certain places online \nwhere people go and they are supposed to be supportive and trustworthy and \nbullies there take advantage of that for their own enjoyment. I was part of \nsuch a site that was supposed to be a community for people with mental \ndisorders. I became accepted as part of the central group but I began to \nrealize how mean they were to others that didn\'t have mental problems as \nbig as ours were. Like you had be at least this "crazy" to receive any sort \nof friendship. One day a new profile came up and scolded us saying that her \ndaughter had killed herself because of the torment she faced on the site. \nAfter that my involvement with those people slowly diminished as I turned \nto other sites that were more regulated, had mods and actual staff. To this \nday, I do not know whether or not that allegation was true but the \npossibility of it haunts me because despite not directly taking part of it, \nI laughed and did not defend the person needing help and support. I\'ve \ngrown since then and have since turned my online community involvement into \nhelping people by giving advice, lending words of comfort and prayer for \nthose that post about their problems.\n\nTL;DR\nMost \'words on a screen\' aren\'t bullying but there are more serious forms. \nI essentially once was a cyber bully, and it\'s a very bad thing.\n\n"Our society is far too sensitive in our hearing and far too insensitive in \nour speaking. We would get along so much better if it were the other way \naround."\n-Me\xef\xbb\xbf'

I had to explain to my \nPrinciple that it was all a joke. She then had to get the guy I commented \non and ask him if it was a joke... of course he said yes and she said \nsorry. Point is people are over reacting on the fact of bullying. If I tell \nsomeone to shut up I automatically become a bully.... I had the same path \nas u Ryan.

aS'Everyone has their own ways of coping with the world. I was someone who was \nbullied in school but because im a highly introverted person, it took other \npeople to point out it out to me for me to realise what had happened. \nequally i think some people are more effected by cyber bullying than \nothers. for those people i think the most powerful tool of any sort of \nbullying isnt confrontation but rather the psychological distress. yes you \ncan delete your account but you will have the thought that "i had to delete \nmy account because no one love me and never will". so yeah disagree that \ncertain types of bullying are more damaging. agree with everything else\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I feel like cyber-bullying shouldn\'t be as big deal of a deal as it is now. \nSure, it hurts to see a mean comment or indirect tweet about you, but since \nit\'s the internet it feels like it\'s one time removed compared to if it was \nsaid out loud/it\'s a troll. Plus, most of the time if someone is too scared \nto bully you in person they\'d make a fake account and you\'d have no idea \nwho it is, so like, whatever, "you don\'t know me and even if you did you\'re \ntoo chicken to say it to my face so your comment is irrelevant" kinda \nthing. And if they\'re just saying it on their real account then other \npeople would see it and probably call them out - the internet can get nasty \nsometimes but it\'s amazing to see how quickly we jump to defend others in \nthese types of situations.\nCyberbullying is definitely an issue if the bully persists though, so I \ntotally agree with Ryan that it\'s not going to stop and we need to \nlearn/teach others how to deal with it.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aNaS"This is really simple. People need to understand that there should be no- \nsuch thing as cyber-Bullying.  Why?  Because like Nigahiga mentioned you \ncan block and delete the offender.  If they make another account to come \nafter you then you make your account available to only friends you know. \n The term cyber-Bully is offensive in itself as it says that people are too \nstupid to understand they can get away from this type of harassment. \n\nNow if somebody takes what they said to you on the internet on to real life \nand stalks you that is clear and present danger and that is the time to \nbecome worried as that becomes actual Harassment.  I have had many people \ncall me names online and I just ignore it.  When I was younger I wore some \nHammer Pants to school (Yes I am ashamed to admit it) and I thought I was \ncool wearing them.  Some people made fun of me but I ignored it and decided \nthat I was better than them.  This was in the face bullying but I learned \nto block it out. So how does somebody a thousand miles away affect you? The \ninternet is a fun place but if somebody made fun of me on the internet \nwearing hammer pants I could easily just block them and never hear from \nthem again.  Or I could just ignore their comment and move on.  People will \nalways be mean because as Humans our emotions drive a lot of our actions.\n\nAs a Father I tell me kids if somebody is bullying you at School to not \ngive them the power and to let them know they can't keep on bothering you. \nMy kids do not have a social network account (basically because they are \ntoo young) but if they ever did they already know that you can delete \nidiots form your network if they are not nice to you.  So please Understand \npeople, The internet is just a public place for people to exchange thoughts \nbut if somebody is mean to you in that public place you can avoid them, if \nyou choose not to then you are giving them the power and making sure that \ntheir words will continue to hurt you. #onlinewordscan'thurt.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"He clearly has no idea how powerful social media can be when used in \npsychological warfare. From leaking nudes to spreading harmful rumours to \n(the less common but possible) hacking and installing viruses/worms to \nsteal data, cyber bullying can be extremely harmful. And it's more \ntroublesome because the crimedoer can be much harder to trace. Falsely \nouting someone's HIV status or stealing an assignment has a lot more \nramifications than most physical bullying. I'm generalizing here based on \nthe nature of different genders, but I feel like I should note that while \nthe typical big-guy bully is horrible, the social warfare games that women \nplay are much worse, especially in certain Asian countries like South \nKorea. Being punched hurts for days (or longer, depending on how many times \nand where, ofc), but something like being blamed for being raped typically \nhurts much longer.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"1:30 understood, but, may I add, that to be cyber bullied, you don't have t \nbe online to be harassed, other people can go online to hear and see the \nstuff that is posted about you in a defamation. One example is where you do \nsomething highly embarrassing, like say, get drunk at a party, you end up \nsleeping with some dude, and some ass hole records and uploads the entire \nthing, or they threaten you to do something and act a certain way to avoid \nthem putting that online. Basically, blackmail. \n2:00 Also, one can run from the source of the harassment yes, but if \neveryone else is doing the same, and, picking on your friends as well, or \nhell, posting incredulous slander. It can be rather hard to maintain a good \nonline reputation even when you have never been online before. Your boss \ncould just look up on a computer your name and bam, all these rumours will \nbe on screen to see. Even if they are all false, it is still troubling and \ncan cost you a job. \n2:35 hat, I can agree with bro! But, it is a start for something in my \nopinion, these campaigns fail because they don't go beyond just voicing an \nopinion or support. They don't encourage the signing of any laws or \npetitions. They don't give out any advice on how to sot, stop, or treat \nbullying and the victims. \nAgain, you are doing great so far.

Like its stupid. Don\'t tell \nme your going to do something, just do it. But anyways, I was bullied \nbecause I was tall and fat (opposite of Ryan lol). I was the shy friendly \ngiant so I just dug my nose in by book and pretended not to listen. Then it \ngot to the point where they were following me around saying "oh god! Its \nearthquake! Oooooohhhh!!!!" So I kept my cool, didn\'t say anything. Not \nlike it hurt me. I was numb to it already, it just made me mad that they \nwould deliberately go out of their way to make me feel bad about myself. So \nwhen I finally got sick of them (and realized I was twice their size) I \nturned around and yelled at them "DONT YOU HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO?! GO \nTHE HELL AWAY." The look I gave them was so infuriated they got scared. \nThey flinched and turned around and never said anything to me again. Like \nRyan said, they didn\'t expect it, and when they realized I wasn\'t just \ngoing to let them do it anymore, they decided teasing the girl who could \nmaul their whole sick little threesome in one fell swoop of a hand, wasn\'t \nsuch a good idea. I didn\'t go to the teacher or my mommy of the principle, \nI never said a word of complaint to anyone, never received help. Sometimes \nwe have to take things into our own hands. That why I dislike weak victims. \nBecause they\'re not victims unless they alow themselves to me. Unless you \nare getting beat physically by someone bigger than you, I\'m pretty sure u \ncan do something on your own. There is this song I love, its called Tears \nOf School and its by a Korean boy group called BTS. At first I just thought \nthe song was cool, but when I saw the translated lyrics it blew me away. \n"Everyone is wrong. There is no such thing as a bystander, victim, \nperpetrator." We are what make them up. And we should know how to them \ndown. Check the song out. Those guys are really good. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'While I agree with giving kids advice to stop bullying. The WRONG advice is \nbeing given. You blame kids for being "weak victims" yet we are fucking \nteaching them to be that way. Kids get bullied to the point where they are \ndepressed and we tell them "Oh just ignore them" or "Avoid contact with \nthem" but lets be real, that shit don\'t work. All its doing is dismissing \nyour responsibility as an adult because you\'re too fucking scared or can\'t \nbe fucked to deal with the bully in question. That\'s what the real problem \nis, lets not even pretend here. Kids are told not to "hit back" but to \n"tell a teacher". Now if you were an adult and someone attacked you and you \nhit back, it would be "self defence" so why is it wrong when you\'re a kid \nto defend yourself. So when adults fail the children and they take things \ninto their own hands by hitting back, they\'re in trouble for it, then you \nwonder why they are such victims, because WE ARE VICTIMISING THEM. I bet \nyou if we taught kids "If anyone physically hurts you, beat their ass" we \nwould watch the rate of bullying PLUMMET. But it won\'t. Cause we teach our \nkids to be victims... then victim blame -.-\xef\xbb\xbf'

aNaS'Growing up a few people made some mean comments to me, but never anything \ntruly bad. In year 4, everyone changed seats when I wasn\'t there, and when \nI came back I was sitting next to the most hated person in the class, who I \nquickly grew to despise. He was a horrible person, and maybe that happened \nbecause he was being bullied, but I didn\'t do anything to him to deserve \nthe treatment I got from him. And surprisingly, that wasn\'t even remotely \nthe problem. His former best friend turned bully, jokingly said that we \nwere a couple, I was angry of course, and explained to him that I\'d never \nhated someone more, but the joke spread like wild fire. In under a month I \nhad a whole group of kids bullying me, with the joke long gone they said \nwhatever came to their minds. The one who\'d started it all even attacked me \nsome days. And when I came back from recess and lunch, I still had to sit \nnext to that horrible kid. We were getting bullied by the same people, but \nthat meant nothing to him. He was ruder than ever, I had no place to escape \nbesides home. This was one of the rare moments where I was really glad that \nI was a twin, it meant that even when I couldn\'t be around what little \nfriends I had, I still had someone there for me.\n\nNext year came by, and the same boys were still bullying me. That boy I had \nto sit next to had left and he wasn\'t even a memory by that point. \nStrangely, it helped nothing. At least 90% of my year was out to get me, \neven those I could once call friend. I had no idea what on earth I\'d done, \nbecause the simple fact of the matter was, I\'d done nothing. I was the \nkindest, sweetest little girl. I did what I was told and didn\'t speak back \nor say things behind people\'s back. I never hurt anyone. But everyone hurt \nme. They black mailed my friends with violence and they all caved in but \none, who had to leave half way through the year, a short time after my \nsister got dragged into things. My bullies started to bully her because she \nwas related to me, because she resembled me, because to them apparently \nthat meant we were the same people. I could\'ve felt horrible at that, that \nI\'d dragged my big sister into hell with me, but I couldn\'t. Because by \nthat point I\'d grown a little, I knew it was their choice, not mine. They \nwere guilty, and I was innocent.\nI had moments where I tried to ignore it, and moments where I passed it off \nas a joke, but being bullied changed me, but not in a good way. I may have \ngotten stronger, but I grew crueller. I\'d decided that the teachers were \nuseless, they literally were making it worse by giving light punishments to \nthe idiots, which sent no message to them. So I struck back with force \nwhenever I could. I was punished more then they were. That place wasn\'t \ngoing to do me or my sister any good, so we left. I\'m not sure whether to \nsay it was weak of us, I was just tired of all their shit. I went into that \nyear a wonderful person, and came out brutally honest and cruel.\n\nHowever, when at my new school people attempted to bully me again, I did \nfind it had helped me. It really had made me stronger. Instead of being \nbullied by well over a hundred, it was a small group, and they didn\'t \nattack us, or act like we were absolute freaks, they just gave us and two \nof our friends the same one insult, the entire year long: \'retard\'.  The \ndifference was so gigantic, it was funny. They were pathetic. I could see \nso clearly. Bullies usually have a reason, sometimes they\'re depressed, \nsometimes they want to seem cool, sometimes they think its the only way to \nfit in. I could see that so clearly, that was why everyone had turned \nagainst me before. But the group now, they were bored, just plain bored, \nand wanted a way to pass the time. And honestly, their dreadful attempt was \nlaughable, so that\'s what we did, we laughed. Anywhere we went, we\'d just \nhear \'retard\', and it was insanely funny to us. We didn\'t care, but they \ndidn\'t stop, it was so stupid. My friend came up with a fantastic idea of \nmaking it even better, and we quickly put it into action. When the \nringleader passed by her and said, "Oi, retard", she replied, "Thanks, I \nknow I\'m a retard." He went to agree but realised what she said halfway \nthrough, and got incredibly confused.\n\nShe turned against us eventually too, but I\'ve always been thankful for the \nlittle tip she\'d given us, it\'s helped a lot.\n\nThat was five years ago now, and a few people still try every now and then \nto harass us and our friends, but we care so little, they soon give up. \nBeing bullied can have negative effects on someone\'s personality, like it \ndid with me, but it gives someone something very important: strength.\nI also agree that cyber bullying isn\'t the main problem, it hurts the same \nyes, but you can escape it, block them, unfriend them, get off the site or \nget off your electronics as a whole. There\'s a whole world out there where \nyou can escape them.  No matter what, bullying isn\'t going to stop, and \ncertainly not anytime soon. what we should be teaching kids instead is how \nto be strong.\xef\xbb\xbf'

I became able to see things from \nother perspectives and stopped feeling sorry for myself and my situation. \nEventually like you say Ryan, I started to be thankful for what I had gone \nthrough, since it had made me become the person I am today.\n\n*There is ALWAYS a way out of the darkness*\xef\xbb\xbf"

p854
aS"I'm not really a long time viewer of yours, so I suppose my opinion won't \nmatter much, but I do feel that many of the points you made were done so in \nignorance about just how pervasive and aggressive cyber bullying is. Many \npeople do like to marginalize cyber bullying to just rude or demeaning \ntexts on one or two social media sites, but that is not how these cases \nwork. For example, cyber bullying can affect people even if they don't have \na media account, because it isn't /just/ restricted to virtual hate.\n\nThere have been cases where a bully will take pictures of the victim in \nprivate, such as in a locker room, and distribute those pictures online. \nOther people might hack accounts, or a friend/lover might betray the \nvictims trust to spread pictures or information around their physical \nenviroment. This information spreads to people in the school, and so the \nharassment continues both at home and in their classrooms.\n\nMany victims do try to delete their accounts, start under a new name, etc, \nbut find that their tormentors will continue to track and harass them \nregardless of the identity they take. To make it worse, many people don't \nconsider online bullying to be a problem because they see social media as \noptional and don't consider how being bullied virtually might translate to \nreal life.\n\nBy telling victims to 'just get over it,' you're really invalidating their \nexperiences. You are insinuating, deliberately or not, that victims of \ncyber bullying are bringing on their own suffering by not following a \nstrict set of guidelines which don't actually work to protect them. \nFurther, you are reinforcing this idea that cyber bullying is \ninsignificant, and therefore they are weak for not being able to shrug it \noff.\n\nI get what you are saying and I am not trying to be a politically correct \nsocial warrior, but I feel like there's nothing to be gained from one \nextreme or the other. Yes, victims need to be told how to protect \nthemselves. They need the skills and tools to ensure they are safe and feel \ndefended. All of this is true. Still, they also need to know that there are \npeople who support them, who they can tell their story to. That's what \npeople tweeting things like this are doing, they're creating a community in \nwhich victims may feel secure. Additionally, they're also trying to educate \nkids about the consequences of being a bully, so that they might be less \nlikely to attack others.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Most people who are cyber bullied are also bullied in real life. \nAnd even if they aren\'t, bullies will find them if they try hard enough.  \nAmanda Todd tried to escape.  She changed schools, changed social medias - \nand that man found ways to get to her, no matter where she went.\n\nThat\'s cyber bullying.  Where\'s the escape in that?\nShe ended up killing herself.  Your "just escape" or "turn off the \ninternet" really isn\'t going to work.  You\'re basically saying that it\'s \nalways going to be there instead of trying to get to the root of the \nproblem.   I\'m not quite sure how that\'s going to stop anything.  Cyber \nbullying is an effect of the bullying mentality.  Both are awful.\n\nI\'m very sorry you were bullied, though.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'ok so for starters so many people are comparing bullying to like rape or \nsomething xD those are two completely different subjects... second hes \nsaying we turn these kids who are being bullied and make them become strong \nand independent and not give a shit about what other people say... isn\'t \nthat what you people have been wanting?!?! yet you say that gives "power to \nthe bullies."  How i went through dealing with bullies was just to deal... \nLife sucks and im not going to spend tax payer money or some bullshit to \nmake it so we can raise some pussy ass kids and beat the shit out of those \nwho probably have it harder than the people they\'re bullying i.e. hard home \nlives which lead them to bullying... Basically what I am saying is if I was \nable to deal with the senseless violence and random insults and never give \na fuck why the hell cant you grow up and realize you don\'t have to deal \nwith these retards forever? School is not a permanent state of being!\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'wow i don\'t understand whats with we should pity them because its the thing \nwe do and what he saying is about blaming the victims  bullying won\'t stop \nno matter what anybody tries it will always continue in one form or \nanother. haven\'t any of you heard the saying "kids are cruel"  i mean hell \nthats really the only thing we can do is either deal with it or take action \nagainst it but no one does that anymore because then you both get in \ntrouble and i don\'t asking them to stop or telling a teacher on them cause \nthen you\'ll be called a snitch witch defeats the purpose. Most people \nbelieve they have nay two basic choices death or dealing most people never \ntouch the other option. the third option is where you either stand up for \nyourself and get physical real life or in cyber bullying if the person \nkeeps finding you and keeps doing what there doing find out who they are in \nreal life and confront them in real life  if they go to your school our you \nknow them helps. then theres the dreaded topic school shooting where the \nkid gets fed up and decides to erase there bullys existence from this world \nusually with a gun but thats besides the point they handled it there way i \nalso think its slightly better than suicide but only slightly well theres \n my rant on stupidity and how violent and cruel we are as a spieces\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"the thing about cyber bullying is its not fun having to escape all the \ntime, sure you can 'avoid the website', block them etc. but some crazy \nassholes will make new accounts and try to still harass you. its not that \nhard to find someone online even if they make new accounts. plus its \ninherently wrong to tell people to stop doing something they enjoy because \nthere's a bully in the same playground (especially when that involves their \njob/future career). many people also make lots of friends on social media, \nand having to escape from a bully can also mean losing contact with all \nthose friends. and then if it becomes a viral thing when the whole internet \nis talking about you it must be just a terrible feeling to know SO many \npeople leave hate comments about you, even if youre not reading them...and \nsometimes cyber-bullying even translates to real life danger (like swatting)\n\nim not saying that anything like hashtags is gonna stop cyber-bullies or \nregular bullies tbh and i dont have a solution, i dont think anybody does, \nbut at least im honest enough to admit that. just saying 'well, get off \nthat website then' is a very simple-minded solution and frankly pretty \nstupid. youre basically giving bullies an excuse to keep it up because \n'well they can just get away if they dont like it'\nif someone played a sport outside of school and there was a bully on their \nteam so they were forced to leave and lose all those friends they made and \nstop playing the sport they love you wouldnt say the same thing, see? but \ntheyd still have 'an escape' by leaving the team....its just not right that \nthey should\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Dear Ryan, I respect you a lot and I really like your videos. However, a \nlot of people I know are victims to cyber bullying and have become very \ndepressed about a lot of the harsh things people say online about them. \nAlongside that, someone I knew actually suicided because of cyber bulling \non askfm and other websites like that. It is a serious problem. Again, love \nyour vids, but this is really offensive to some people and I think making \nthis video was a bad idea.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Why are some people actually getting pissed at this opnion? It is so \nlogical. Bullying is not going to stop (You must be away with the fairies \nif you think it will), often people are bullied more when they tell someone \nthey are being bullied. The issue with bullying is how you are left feeling \nafterwards, the best thing for that is proper support and showing them how \nthe bullies do not rule their life. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p990
aS"People in the comments keep comparing bullying to rape or murder and say \nthat Ryan is saying that we shouldn't try to stop it and that its on the \nvictims to do something about it. That's not what he's saying! OFCOURSE the \nmessage to rapists and murderers that they should stop or be arrested is \ncorrect. But I agree with Ryan on the bullying thing. Bullying happens on a \ndaily basis to ALOT of people and hashtagging stuff really isn't going to \nhelp. Especially since penalties like JAIL aren't applicable to everyday \nbullying. He's saying that since the bullying won't stop (and it probably \nwon't unfortunately) the victims should find a way to either avoid it or go \nagainst it. Its not easy but it IS possible E.g Ryan's story.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"My parents always told me, 'ignore them'. I listened and listened and what \nthat led up to was some asshole started throwing stones at me in the \nstreets and once they even hit me with sticks because they knew I didn't do \nanything. I told the teachers and they thought the assholes were just \nplaying around. They even told me not to be a tattle tale.\nNever EVER tell someone to ignore the bully. Telling someone is important \nbut you will be quite unpopular. Here is some solid advice on how to deal \nwith it:\nIf you're bullied: fight back. \nAre they too big for you to handle? Make some friends and fight them, if \nyou can, if you think you can take one of them take them on.\nOnce some girls were hitting me in public and calling me names, but I \nignored them. Then they asked me to fight in a secluded area. Of course I \nagreed, since I knew I could take her on. We fought, I won and they didn't \nlay a finger on me to this day, and that happened 4-5 years ago.\nAre they calling you names? Call them names straight back. If they insult \nyour race you should insult theirs right back and worse.\nAre they about to hit you and you're defenceless or know you won't be able \nto win? Scream as loud and as annoyingly as you can and attract attention. \nHell, even say some bullshit out loud to distract them from punching you \nuntil you have a solid plan to get out unharmed. If you're sure you can win \nthem go to a secluded place or else just solve it in public.\nBe as hardworking and quiet as you can around teachers; they're your allies \nmost of the time.\nIf you are caught by the teachers for responding to the bully then cry. \nTears win them over so quickly it's sickening. Once I was tired of the \nbullying I made fun of them infront of the teacher, so they called me in so \nthey could call my parents in front of me. I burst into tears and said how \nthey bullied me and then they were in trouble instead of me, and my parents \nwere never called.\nDo anything you can to resist them but just don't ignore them. That is \ncalled a pussy move. I wish someone could give me this aggressive approach \nwhen I was a kid; I'm happily in college with lots of friends and no \nbullies.\nIf you want a more passive way; then ask them calmly, 'Why are you being \nlike this to me?' Or 'What did I ever do to you?' - then if you really want \nto push them off you should cry. But the passive way is so lame I would \nnever recommend it unless you're very, very weak.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"I really agree with this. Even though the stuff cyber bullies say before \nyou block them can be really harsh and still hurt you (especially when they \nare people you know in real life) you do have an out. You can block them \nand choose to make your life happier without them. I was cyber bullied by \nall my old friends when one of them decided to date my ex (first long term \nboyfriend) 2 weeks after we broke up. She was my bestfriend and it really \nhurt me. I didn't do anything and they just turned on me and said a mean \nvariety of things. I was ganged up on by all of my close friends who I \nreally trusted. They didn't just message me but commented on every status \nand photo I added to Facebook. (And would sometimes text me.) I was \nemotionally scarred but after blocking them things started getting better \nas I slowly made new friends. You have to block them and get them out of \nyour life.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I was bullied and beat up a lot at school. I went to school in Finland... \nNordic country.... not a lot of brown people there. I was called a nigger, \nblack shit etc. I was excluded, beaten up, left to cry in a corner after a \nsurprise attack where they strangled me until I almost passed out and beat \nme while I was on the floor... Hardcore bullying, like these kids were \nracist as fuck. I understood later that it was \'cos they had nothing better \nto do, they were young and some of them (not all) had racist parents. \nBut during third grade I grew in size and after fighting so much during \nthose first years of school I\'d learned how to fight dirty with the bullies \nplus I was learning martial arts, so on third grade when they grouped up on \nme, I found myself a weapon from the ground, be it a rock or a stick etc, \nand I did get my ass beat, but now I wasn\'t the only one. I made sure that \neach bully left these fights either bruised or blood flowing from \nsomewhere. This continued during that third year and I was getting a lot \nbigger and stronger to the extent that when the bullies came for me for the \nlast time it went down like this. There were at least 30 students watching \nthere were 4 bullies from the 6th and 5th grades. 3 of them were calling me \nnames while the fourth took a metal stick and started beating me with it. \nWhile he beat me he laughed and called me a nigger. I called him a milk \nfaced fucker. He laughed and beat me. I spat on him, he spat on me. He \ncontinued beating. I got really angry and when the next hit came I grabbed \nthe iron rod, it hurt like hell but I yanked it off him while he was \nsurprised. I started beating him back. \nHe laughed at first and I got even more angry I started beating as hard as \nI could. His friends came to take the rod away, I swung it in big arcs to \nkeep them at bay. They grabbed my hands and pulled the rod away. I bit one \nof their hands... Hard, and yanked away kicking them and screaming bloody \nmurder. Then they left. I was too much trouble for them.\n\nOnce before that when one guy came to bully me he called me a laku-pekka \nwhich is a derogatory term in finnish for black people. I looked at him and \nwalked up to him, he pushed me and asked what?. I walked back at him and \nyelled at him "Call me a nigger!" He looked shocked and was like "What?" I \nshouted it at him again "Call me a nigger!" He told me "NO!" \nI kept shouting it at him and he backed away telling me "You\'re mad, go \naway, no, what the fuck". I kept on shouting "Call me a nigger you fucking \ncoward do it!!!" I continued until the teacher came and asked what was \nhappening. He never bullied me again. \n\nBullying made me cruel and viscous. I did things to people who bullied me \nthat make me sick now. Like this one kid on fifth grade whose father had \ndied when he had been 4, was calling me a nigger so I told him this "I \nmight be a nigger but at least my dad is still alive" He looked fucking \ndevastated. I must have hurt him a shit ton, and I was happy about it back \nthen. So I started bullying him back and made that year of his life hell. I \nfeel really bad abut it now.\n\nBut I made it a principle to beat or hurt my bullies back then, and many \ntimes I succeeded. There were these two kids who used to bully me a lot, \nkick me and call me names. They accidentally burned down a building, they \nare still probs paying the bills. \n\nI was 9 at the time and I heard about it and when next I saw them I told \nthem this "Hey pyromaniacs! Is it fun to know that you\'ll be paying for \nthat stunt for the rest of your lives? Hahahahaha" They got really really \nmad and chased me while I laughed at the top of my lungs at the anguish of \nmy bullies. \n\nSo yeah, bullying made me a cruel manipulative person... Great thing.\n\nBut thanks to friends I got later and a school change I got a lot milder \nand friendlier. Now people tell me that they can\'t imagine me being \naggressive.\xef\xbb\xbf'

And one of \nthose punks told on their older sister that i hit them. \n\nAnd you know what sucks about middle school and high school? I hate it when \nthe bully/bullies almost never get in trouble and the victim takes all the \nblame. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'i dont mean to spoilyour party but i must say that while it is good that \nyou found a way to deal with your bullying, it didnt really much help you \nin terms of character, i mean in theory. what im saying is the fact that \nyou were someone else until you started to deal with your bullying, and \nwhat you did when you dealt with the bullying was make people laugh by \nmaking it your joke, and since that worked so well it became your life, but \nin doing so you receded into your defense mechanism thus collaterally \ncreating a barrier between the true you, and the outside of you. I am not \nsaying this is what it is, this is just something i started thinking of, \nand i thought id share, because maybe if you read this ryan it could mean \nsomething to you, if im right that is.

aS"A couple of days ago, the daughter of legendary comedian and suicide victim \nRobin Williams deleted her Twitter after she started getting comments with \nphotoshopped pictures of her deceased father. That's cyber bullying and it \nis just as nasty as full bullying. \n\nWhen you say people have the option of blocking people, un friending people \nor deleting their account, that's ignorant of the fact that in a lot of \ncases, people know their cyber bullies in real life. It takes the bullying \nfrom the schoolyard to the bedroom. And another thing, why should someone \nhave to delete their social media accounts just because some dickhead \nthinks it is OK taunt and bully them from behind a keyboard? Bullies don't \nget right of way. \n\nAnother terrible thing about the concept of cyber bullying which makes it \njust as important as it is right now is is the anonymity of it. I could \nliterally just make an account right now with an alias, with no profile \npicture and start belting people. I mean just the fact alone that people \nare willing to have hurt someone is bad enough but then to give people who \ndo this a screen behind which to push people around, it is STILL something \nwe need to address with vigor.\n\nAnd finally I make the point. You are a young adult and you have made a \nliving off of technology. Both you and I know the internet very well and \nhave a lot of experience with an online presence. But not everyone is as \nexperienced as us when it comes to online presence, so when someone ones up \ntheir email and sees a death threat in their inbox, they are vulnerable.\n\nWhile we know to contact the email service and put a report in, take note \nof the email address and then delete it, some thirteen year old kid with \nnot so much experience with the internet doesn't know that, they're not as \nstrong as you or I. \n\nMate, I am fine with people having unpopular opinions, I have a couple \nmyself but not when lives are on the line. One of the major pioneers of \nmodern slapstick comedy tok his own life yesterday. People take their own \nloves every week because of bullying. Cyber bullying IS a type of bullying, \nnot a #fwp. I mean feel free to have opinions but lives are on the line if \nwe undermine this issue. It needs to be regulated by law but first and \nforemost it needs to be understood.\xef\xbb\xbf"

And more important, teaching children to \ncope and handle bullying is a valuable lesson that could help thousands of \nkids.  NOT that it excuses the bullying, but the truth is we can only \nchange ourselves.

aS"+Ryan Higa thank you for telling such a wonderful story :). You might have \nbeen looking for a word called 'antifrigile'. Antifragility is our ability \nto grow as a result of being damaged (opposite to fragility). Also, I don't \nagree with you when you said cyber bullying can be easily avoid - not in \nall cases anyway. Many cyber bullying cases which has led to suicides (my \ninfo is mostly from UK) involves hacking for personal pictures from social \nmedia, taking inappropriate pictures of victims or even photoshopping and \nusing those private pictures to threaten and manipulate the victim. In \nthese cases, running away seems like a unlikely option as most of us would \nnot want our private pictures going all over the Internet. And as always, \nkeep making these awesome videos!

aS"I disagree entirely.\n\nMaybe a few years ago, you would have a point about words on a screen and \nsocial media being something you can turn off, but in the past few years, \nwith so much of our lives online, it's not as easy. If a humiliating \npicture goes viral, for instance, it can be hard for the victim to reclaim \nhis or her image. Furthermore, with entire communities dedicated to \nspreading information about their victims, these things can haunt the \naffected well into their careers.\n\nWorse yet is that it's not just kids who are getting cyberbullied. This \nphenomenon is more prevalent among adults, these days, since assaulting a \nperson tends to get the bully put in jail.  However, if you ruin someone's \nprofessional reputation and deny him or her access by colluding with peers \nacross the Internet, the victim often has no recourse against mockery that \ndenies him or her employment.  It doesn't make the victim stronger, because \nthe victim has been denied a chance to work.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'You know I fully understand what it\'s like to want to kill yourself. I \nlegitimately tried but it went...well wrong XD people these days tho, \nthreatening to do it, those are the ones asking for attention. "Hey look at \nme everyone! I\'m sad therefore you guys should care!" The real story is the \nperson who seems happy, but really isn\'t. The one who gets home and locks \nthemselves in their room scanning it looking for things to end themselves \nwith. Those are the real victims not some 13 girl unhappy she got called \nfat once. Oh and cutting? Eqaully as childish. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"The funny thing is I Live in Australia.\nEveryone here wants to act like a bully and wants to be cool but they are \nactually little insecure bitches inside, although personally I never \nbullied I ate bitches like that up in school. Sorry bro coz you got bullied \ni've never been bullied so I don't know what it feels like but from what \ni've seen is that if you let a bully bully you the first time then you will \nbe their plaything. So my advice is the first time they try to bully you \nthe first time stand your own the first time and then they won't really do \nit. 2nd piece of advice if a group of guys bullies you (although diplomacy \nbefore violence is better) grab one of these guys and beat the crap out of \nhim use him as an example to the others and you will be left alone and good \nluck\xef\xbb\xbf"

p1185
aS'Well, I agree with you up to a point but I think this topic is way more \ncomplex than what most people make it out to be. How kids are able to cope \nwith bullying largely depends on their family and financial background, \ntheir personality, the school system they fall under...etc etc so we could \nsay that every case is different.\xef\xbb\xbf'

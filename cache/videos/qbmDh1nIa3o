aS'Well yes, but Ryan\'s channel is "nigahiga" and he was called his full name. \nAnd I believe Dominic\'s YouTube channel is "theDOMINICshow" whereas he was \ncalled D-Trix, a nickname. Arden Cho had her full name. I think "Kassem G" \nis Kassem\'s channel, but it\'s also his name and I don\'t know anything about \n"Hiimrawn". I just was pointing out that it was funny that Ian and Anthony \nwere the only one\'s not called something that could be construed as a name, \nnickname or otherwise.'

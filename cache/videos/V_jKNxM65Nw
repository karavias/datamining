S'its sad how many people do not understand at all what feminism is about. \nits not about making women superior to men, its also not only about women. \nits about both genders being treated in an equal way. on all grounds (eg, \nmaking women earn same money as men but also making men be able to express \ntheir emotion without being called gay/twat/fag). it started as feminism \nbecause women were treated far worse than men but nowadays feminists see \nthat it is not only about fighting for womens rights but also mans. we see \nthat the world isnt equal on both sides. all you gotta do to understand \nthat shit is listen to the right people who actually know what feminism is \nabout. emma watson has said in her speach all what i just expressed - its \nnot only about women, but about everyone. so do some fucking research \nbefore you start calling feminists names cus bitch they fight for all of \nus. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p10
aS"Feminism has destroyed the American family. Now both parents work, if \nthey're not divorced already, so bankers can charge more for homes because \nof dual incomes. Infidelity is higher than ever because women use sex to \nclimb the corporate ladder. Millions of babies are killed while in the womb \nbecause of a woman's right to choose. Marriage is on a historic decline \nbecause men simply don't trust women. If the woman divorces the hard \nworking man, he has to give her a check each month for the rest of his \nlife. Why do you think Robin Williams killed himself? After all the \nfighting for equal rights do you know the #1 profession for women? \nSecretary. Hope it was worth it you fuckn gold diggn bitches. \xef\xbb\xbf"

p13
aS'The only thing I want out of feminism is equal pay, and men without the \nright to reign superiority over women.  The right to marry your daughter \noff without consent. The right to abuse your family because you are the \n"man of the family" and therefore have the right to do whatever you want. \n And I want people to stop blaming rape victims.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p14
aS'asking a guy for his abs is just like asking a girl for her belly or legs.\nwhy do you compare it with asking for boobs thats a private part of the \nfemale body.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p15
aS"Dear everyone,\n\nI'm very sorry for all the 'fake' feminists. (aka the ones who think women \nshould have more rights then men.) The point of feminism is wanting equal \nrights, but apparently some girls really don't get this. We can cry in \npublic, you can. You can hold a door, we can. I want equality not a Hitler \n2.0 nazi against men.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p16
aS"We don't judge Nazis by what the word Nazism means. \nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/Nazism We judge the Nazis by their actions.\n\nSimilarly we shouldn't judge feminists by what the word feminism means. We \nshould judge feminists by their actions.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p19
aS'Girls think they can have more rights than men. Oh hell no. We men have to \nopen doors. But girls don\'t open doors for us. Girls always ask guys if \nthey can see their "sexy" abs. But if a guy ask a girl to show her boobs \nthe guy gets bitch slap and seriously. Periods are just an excuse to be a \nbitch.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p20
aS"i seriously agree with this video... i just hate how feminists sometimes \nexaggerate and think women are always treated unequally when women are the \nones who make it seem like it's unequal..\xef\xbb\xbf"
p21
aS'I am honestly sick of "Feminist\n"....\xef\xbb\xbf'
p22
aS"You know, guys aren' forced to pay for meals and buy flowers and all that, \nthey can choose not to. They're just doing it to be polite (which is \ngreat), but girls don't have a choice when it comes to periods. We have to \npay for pads or tampons, we get extremly hungry (which will make us fatter, \nwhich will lead to men not liking us) and we get moody (and no, we can't \ncontrol it). Do you know how expensive it is to have periods? We have to \npay for that shit for at least 30 years. I think you can pay for some \nflowers and open a fucking door.\nDon't get me wrong, I want equality for both men and women, but don't \ncomplain bc you have to pay 5 dollars for some flowers when we have to pay \nway more for pads and tampons, something we can't control.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"just so you know i'm 13 and my boyfriend is the same age)  0:47 not true I \nopened  the door for my boyfriend 0:57 I gave him gifts and he gave me \ngifts  1:12 tbh I agree he never spends time with me the last time we \ntalked was on the last day of school and god knows when that was 1:36 he \nnever said anything like that to me\xef\xbb\xbf"
p25
aS'Ok, talk about equality! So how you think about giving birth Ryan? Do men \ngive birth? Of course not!\nI think the equality here is respect women and appreciate them because all \nof things the mothers have to accept when they give birth us.\nMay be men have to give flowers and open a door, be a gentleman, strong, \nblah blah, ...but those thing is nothing to compare with nine months \npregnant of the mother and the pain of giving birth. \nI think these womens are deserved those little nice things.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I am so annoyed with all the people who are saying feminism is bullshit! \nFeminism is fighting for equality between men and women! All we want is for \nall genders to live in peace, with equal rights and without being judged \nfor how people act and dress! \xef\xbb\xbf'

p30
aS"That's exactly what feminists want....that's literally exactly what we r \ntrying to do....\xef\xbb\xbf"
p31
aS'Masculinity is systematically valued over femininity in our society. As a \nresult, men are expected to follow rigid standards of masculinity (not \nbeing allowed to show emotion, having to be "the best" at everything, \nhaving to play the active role in relationships, etc). This is often bad \nfor men. However, since femininity is socially assigned to women, women are \nat an inherent disadvantage in terms of what society values most. The goal \nof liberal feminism is to end the fact that masculinity is valued over \nfemininity, which harms both genders but has systematically oppressed women \nthroughout history. I don\'t think it really does any good to go around \nplaying the blame game or speaking our about feminism (for or against) if \nyou aren\'t educated about what it really is. Please, if an opinion or \nmovement bothers you, go learn about what it really is and make your own \nconclusions instead of throwing criticisms at it.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p49
aS'I know this was made more than three years ago and you probably know better \nnow, but Ryan, Feminism is not just Girls being pro girls, its about people \nbeing pro equality, and destroying the harmful standards that patriarchy \nhas set for everyone. Men are supposed to hold doors and stuff because \npatriarchy dictates that men be the protectors and, that women are weak and \nshould be treated like they are fragile. Patriarchy is just as harmful to \nevery gender, and fighting it, is all what true feminism is all about.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p54
aS"You're right!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p55
aS'When a girl askes a guy for money and he respond "I don\'t have anymore \nmoney" he is a broke loser, but the thing is that the girl was the one \nasking for money, so isn\'t she the broke loser?\nAnd it\'s ok for a girl to say to a guy he is fat/ugly/gross (you name it), \nbut a guy can never say something like that to a girl.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p56
aS"In all honestly I feel feminists go against what they are trying to do. If \nthey wanna spread equality, why not call it huminist.. Lol. No but really, \nequally means we act as if the gender is nothing. Putting down or expecting \nsomething from the other gender just because of their gender, isn't \npracticing equally. We all, male and female make that mistake. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p57
aS' #TrueEquality  thats right im makeing a trend spread it round!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p58
aS"Well, I kind of think it comes down to the woman. I mean, being mean and \nrude to girls isn't going to do you any favors, especially if you're trying \nto, ahem, share a bed with her (bowchicawowow). But if being overly polite \noffends her, just talk and act towards her the same way you would a friend. \nIf she actively tells you to be mean towards her... Ummm.. She's pretty \nstrange. Just remember though, they kinda are the ones who go through \npregnancy, and they're also the ones (most) men find attractive. Just \nsayin'\xef\xbb\xbf"
p59
aS'Ryan this is the deal. The reason guys are "obliged" to do all this stuff \nfor girls is because guys treat girls like they are helpless and can\'t open \ndoors or crap. If you think about it the whole boyfriend situation doesn\'t \napply to a lot of feminists because they don\'t have boyfriends. This is \nwhat we are pushing for. We WANT everything to be equal. Treat us like your \nbros. And in this video you just stereotyped girls hugely. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p60
aS"Not help u get a gf?!? Dude!!!! Ur like... Like... Let's just say alotta \nfangurls out there r dying to meet u!!!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p61
aS'For heavens sake the definition of a feminist is someone who wants equality \nfor both genders!! People who think females are better than males are not \nreal feminists, so stop blaming an entire group for the opinions of a few \nextremists\xef\xbb\xbf'
p62
aS"I hold the door open for my boyfriend and he doesn't get all jive about it.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p63
aS"I agree with the video apart from the fact that you don't have to be a girl \nto want equality and therefor be a feminist.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p64
aS'I am a feminist and I agree completely. And I think if girls want those \ndouble standarts you mentioned they shouldnt call themselves feminists. \nBecause it stands for equality, women and men both.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p65
aS'The other day I was with my family at ikea looking for mattresses for my \nsister when I saw a couple arguing. I didnt mean to eavesdrop but my family \nwas checking our the mattresses so I heard them. The woman was telling the \nman how he should help around the house with the cooking and cleaning while \nthe man said that if he does that she should help with the mowing and \nmechanics and she said "you men always look down upon us women! You men are \nso macho and never treat us equally! Such a bad boyfriend!" And I was like \n"...da fudge?" The guy said that he doesnt cook and clean because he doesnt \nknow how and that he usually does it wrong according to her. She said "bah! \nYou have me cook and clean because im a female and thats what we are \nsuppose to do!" Then the woman saw me hearing this, pulled me to them, and \nasked me "dont you agree?" I looked at the woman, then man, then me, being \nthe judge here, said "um, technically neither side will ever be equal. Also \nyour boyfriend is right about the mowing/cooking part. My mom cooks and \ncleans the house while my dad mows the lawn and fixes everything and \nneither complain. Its fair because my dad cant cook or clean and my mom \ndoesnt mow or fix stuff. And you take this female thing too seriously. Your \nboyfriend clearly doesnt stereotype you, you\'re just stereotyping yourself. \nI grew up in a home where I was treated the same way the boys were treated \nand the boys were treated the same way I was treated, so I think I know \nequality. This next part I didnt think through well enough Also, if you \nwant someone who will agree with you, find yourself a feminist like you." \nThe woman stared at me while the man nodded as if I was the greatest thing \nsice sliced bread, and then the woman proceeded to explain to me how unfair \nmen are to woman. I stood there finding this all bull when my parents \nnoticed this and pulled me away awkwardly, asking me what happened. I told \nthem and thy facepalmed, calling the woman "stupid feminist"\n\nYah.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p66
aS"I'm a female\nI love video games\nI don't like shopping, unless it's a 'video games' shopping or connected to \ntechnology\nI like sports\nI quite often open door for ppl, because I just think that it's polite\nI'd love to give a gift to a person I'm in relationship with, because I \nthink that giving smth is as awesome as receiving it\nI don't mind to pay for a person I'm interested in bar/cafe/restaurant\xef\xbb\xbf"

p80
aS"Being equal doesn't mean the you are the same or deserve the same things. \ne.g. if you have 2 kids (a 15 year old and a 5 year old), they are equally \nimportant to you but you don't give them the same rights and \nresponsibilities just because they are equal. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p81
aS'"Feminism :  the belief that men and women should have equal rights and \nopportunities."\nI don\'t see what is so wrong about feminism.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p82
aS"about the boobs thing, boobs are considered a sex organ (and therefore \nobscene) by society even though they aren't. they're secondary sex organs, \njust like a male's enlarged adam's apple and facial hair. \ni think a lot of feminists need to cool their shit. i absolutely support \nthe idea of equality but so many feminists use this movement to complain \nabout first world problems. i'm not saying these stereotypes and things we \nexperience aren't issues, but there are still countries where men can \nlegally beat their wives and women cannot leave the house without a man, \nand even then has to cover up from head to toe. there is still rape and \nvictim blaming. that is the kind of oppression feminism is supposed to \nsolve, not boys telling you to play healer in your rpg game. that is not \noppression. it is annoying, but it is not oppression.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p85
aS'I feel as if a lot of people use "feminism" wrong. It means equality \nbetween men and women, but some girls take feminism as self entitlement. \nBeing a guy has its gender issues, and being a girl has its own gender \nissues. I feel as if a lot of feminists take feminism to the point of being \nanti-men and misandry. Which is completely aside the point of feminism! The \npoint isn\'t to hate on men and complain about all the bad stuff they do. \nBoth men and women can be sexist towards each other, there are bad double \nstandards towards BOTH genders. Some feminists complain about EVERY single \nthing that guys do towards girls, and that\'s why feminists as a whole have \na bad reputation now (especially if you\'re a female feminist, if you\'re a \nmale feminist, you don\'t get as much hate.) I see a lot of generalizations \nin the comments. Not all feminists are annoying male hating girls, not all \nmen are sexist shallow jerks. Feminists get generalized this way because of \nthe extremist few who make the entire group look bad. \nI think that equality means not just appealing towards the female side, but \ntowards both genders. I hope I didn\'t offend anyone (and sorry for the \nlarge block of text.) I just dislike seeing all this useless hate between \neveryone, because that isn\'t going to solve our problems.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"Damn I remember when I was excited and couldn't wait for this video to come \nout xD \xef\xbb\xbf"
p91
aS'Everyone in the comments bitching about their opinion... Can I just say \nsomething? Those of both sexes seem to be complaining about how it\'s unfair \nfor /them/, and how really the other sex has it better, or how it\'s not \nreally that bad, or that they\'re just not seeing the "big picture". But \nperhaps the "big picture", is that, on some levels, inequality exists \neverywhere. Men and Women have always been and will always be equally \nhuman. Neither gender is a sub-human species. But because of the injustices \nwe feel are forced on us due to our particular genitalia, we want society \nto recognize whatever discriminations and hardships we feel weighing on our \nshoulders as we go through our lives. We feel that life is hard for /us/, \nand when thinking and speaking on inequality, we may or may not grow a \nbitterness towards the other sex, as we don\'t experience their hardships \nand therefore can\'t really account for them. Don\'t account for them. Won\'t \naccount for them.   \n\nThus, isn\'t it entirely possible that we become ignorant, turn blinded \neyes, and create a bias? The very thing we strive /not/ to do, when \nreaching for equality?  \n\nI won\'t pretend that I have "all the answers", or really any at all, but if \nyou\'ll permit me to ask something of you, I simply ask this: When you\'re \nthinking of making a statement on inequality to express your opinion and \nconcepts, consider what your opposite has gone through. Consider their \njourney, their hardships, their struggles. If you do this without the use \nof prejudice, then I think you\'ll find that life is not exactly easy for \nanyone, and you might be able to understand where the other is coming from \na hundred times better. :)   \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"He said in the beginning that he's all for equal rights, and that's exactly \nwhat feminism is. He brings up points that I never thought of for men. I \ncan definitely add these things to why I stand for equality. But I don't \nsee why he's polarizing the issue. Feminism is not the reason these \nexpectations are set upon him for being male. I really don't see why he \nfelt the need to address this video specifically to feminists though. He \nshould address it to everyone. I think this is a great example for how \nfeminists get called out for not advocating male rights. Videos like this \nare kinda annoying to feminists because only with feminism do you see \npeople getting angry for not representing the opposition. With pro gay \nactivism you don't see people asking what about heterosexuals rights? Or \neven with the anti racism movement you don't usually hear people asking \nwhat about Caucasian's rights? So why do we do this with feminism?\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I think maybe extreme feminists have the same type of syndrome as anti-gay \npreachers do.. They preach against something that they themselves actually \nare, but they hate themselves for it, for one reason or another, but they \nchannel all that hatred towards other people, because they\'re too scared or \nproud to admit they actually sometimes do feel the things they shouldn\'t by \ntheir own standards feel. They have to shout louder and louder to shut \ntheir brains up. \n\nNothing wrong with being emotional or "weak" sometimes, we all are. But \nthey\'re not allowing themselves to be that, because something has happened \nto them in the past that has turned them path into these horrible people. I \nthink it is ironically true, that an angry extreme feminist or homophobe \nmight actually just need a hug, and help to getting a stick planted \nsideways into their asses out. \xef\xbb\xbf'

p130
aS'As a woman I agree with everything said here, Ryan. It makes me mad when \nwomen think they are entitled to more respect and more privileges than men, \ne.g getting flowers every day, getting the door opened for them, constantly \ngetting paid for in restaurants, etc. just because they MIGHT give birth \none day, because they get their period every month ("oooh, nature is so \nsexist against women!" Get the fuck over it..) and because they couldn\'t \nvote like hundreds of years ago.\n\nThose aren\'t good reasons in my opinion. I mean, first you want to be \ntreated as equals, then you want to have the ground beneath your feet \nkissed because you have a vagina?\n\nEqual means being treated like a person, not like a man or like a woman, \nyet many women want to be treated differently because of their gender if it \nbenefits them. You can see in this comment section how few women actually \ncare about men\'s issues, some of them dripping with sarcasm "Yeah, as if \nmen need more rights" etc.\n\nFact is, men do have a lot more issues than the media portrays. Society \nvictimizes women and bedevils men, which is harmful to both genders.\n\nWhat confuses me most is how girls here say "Maybe you\'re right, Ryan, but \nwomen are more oppressed blah blah blah".\n\nHow is that a good reason to trivialize sexism against men and leave the \nmatter unadressed? How is that relevant to this video? On literally every \nvideo that adresses guys issues there are some people who say "BUT WOMEN \nHAVE IT WORSE!" and I don\'t get how that\'s an argument to ignore these \nissues.\n\nDid anyone reading this know that almost half of the victims of severe \ndomestic violence are male? I bet all my money that no one did and that\'s \nwhy not only misogyny needs to be adressed, but also misandry. Don\'t forget \nthat this could also affect your son, your father, your brother, your \nfriend, etc.\n\nSexism against men needs much more attention. If you bring up the \noppression of women hundreds of years ago to argue against that, don\'t even \ntalk to me.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"So a lot of what you were talking about isn't actually on the typical \nfemenist's agenda. Being a part of a large femenist community, what we \nmainly want are the things like equal pay, ability to dress as we please \nand less objectification of women. Many of us do believe that men should \nnot have to open the door for us as it is insinuating that women are too \nweak to open it themselves. Femenists are also not exclusively female and I \nfeel that we have been largely misrepresented in the media. What we find \nannoying is not being told that we look hot or whatever, but rather that \nwomen are seen often as purely sex objects in the media and men are less \nlikely to be put in the same positions. But I do agree with your basic \npremise of the whole muscle thing. \nFemenism is a necessary part of society because there is so much inherent, \nunconscious sexism that takes place towards women that some even dare to \nsay doesn't exist. I suggest that the people in the comments that say they \ndon't need femenism need to do some serious thinking followed by research. \nWomen are dealt the worst hand in society. Yes, men have problems too, but \nbeing a woman is specifically difficult. Just think of most of the common \ninsults. A lot of them revolve around the idea that femininity is weak (eg: \nyou're such a pussy)\n\nProblems like these exist and denying them is as bad as helping them \nhappen. \xef\xbb\xbf"

But the thing is that so many of us take the word \n"Feminist" as a bad thing, and really it\'s not. Because of some people who \ntake the "get-equality" ideology too far, people now-a-days mistake \nFeminism with a Genocide Complex. \n\nMoral of this: Equality, good.

aS'About the "take off your shirt" thing:\nWell, let\'s take the example of swimwear. It is seen as normal for a man to \nbe topless and wear only shorts/speedos at the beach, while girls either \nhave a one piece or a bikini that hides their BREASTS, because female \nbreasts are sexualized and seen as private parts, while man\'s breasts are \nnot. Women have grown up this way, and that\'s why they get \'sensitive\' \nabout it.\n\nIt\'ll be a different story when topless women are legalized. Fortunately, \nit has been legalized in some parts of America, but as long as breasts are \nsexualized and as long as kids go "AHHH! BOOBIES!!!!!!!" whenever they see \na bit of skin up there, girls WILL be \'sensitive\' about it.\n\nYes, it is true that women got many rights nowadays, but that is mainly in \nAmerica and Europe. The rest of the entire whole is suffering from sexism \nagainst women. Thousands of women are \'owned\' by men, thousands of women \nare raped, thousands of women can\'t make their own decisions, thousand of \nwomen are seen as mere beings, not human beings.\n\nWhat feminists don\'t like in particular is the fact that women are still \nseen inferior. That women get abused and can\'t walk safely at night. That \nwomen can\'t even walk home with their keys in hand in fear that some man \nsees that they\'re home alone. That guys can just go "Hey bros! Let\'s go to \nthe club tonight and get hellaaaaaaaaaa wasted!" and not worry about \nanything, while a group of girl would say "Alright girls, don\'t forget to \ncarry your pepper spays in your wallet, to always stick together and to \ndrink moderately! Never leave your drink alone in case some nasty pig drops \nsomething bad in it! All good? Okay!"\n\nWhat a guy would say: "Not all men!"\nWhat every father says to his daughter: "Yes, every single one of them."\n\nSo, yes, it is true that women have earned many rights throughout the years \nthat feminists have fought for, but there is still a lot of cruelty going \non in this world, inside and outside of America/Europe.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I\'ve seen one or two people talking about how women have to deal with \nthings like rape culture and have in general more serious issues than men.\n\nHowever men have to deal with the exact same thing too. Victim shaming and \nrape are *not* gender issues, they are human issues and many people in this \ncomment section here don\'t seem to realize that.\n\nType in "Male Rape", you will find millions of men sharing their stories of \nhow they have been raped (outside of prison) and only got scorn and mockery \nwhen they opened up about it.\n\nAlso guys who were molested when they were children- you might say that \ndoesn\'t count, but if you think about it, grown men who were abused as kids \nalso aren\'t able to open up about what happened to them in their adulthood \nbecause they aren\'t supposed to show emotions- if that isn\'t sexism, I \ndon\'t know what is.\n\nAnd let\'s not forget prison rape. If you count in prison rape, there are \nmore male rape victims in the US than female victims, still it\'s one of the \nmost ridiculed issues there is. And now don\'t say "Well, they don\'t deserve \nbetter."\n\nFirst: No one deserves to be raped, except maybe rapists themselves. It\'s \nwhat society constantly preaches us when it comes to rape victims, so I \ndon\'t know why it would be different for prisoners.\nSecond: People go to jail for things like drug dealing, or other crimes \nthat are not really as bad as raping and killing. If rape really is the \nworst crime ever, how do these "minor" crimes deserve to be punished with \nthat?\n\nFemale rape is an acknowleged problem, male rape is not. It\'s a taboo topic \nand it gets laughed at constantly, and also, male rape victims have no \nplace to go to. A man once called a rape crisis center and was told "We \nonly help women". I\'m not denying a rape culture for women here ("You \ndressed slutty, so it was your fault", etc), however over all it\'s seen as \none of the worst crimes to happen to a woman- all while no one is even \naware of the fact that men can be victimized too, and if people *are* \naware, they laugh.\n\nEvery male rape victim will either get called lucky- if raped by a woman, \nor they will get called gay, or if they *are* gay they will be told they \nmust have asked for it, or they just will get laughed at or told to "man \nup". *Everyone* in whose presence I\'ve mentioned "Male rape" has either \ncracked up or looked at me as if I was crazy, while they were serious as \nlong as it was about women.\n\nSame with domestic violence.\nAnd there are a lot of other issues like men getting punished harder by the \nlaw than women even if they comitted the same crime, men not being taken \nseriously if they want to talk about their issues because they are the \n"Opressors", men always falling short in custody cases, men not being able \nto work with children without being called pedophiles, men constanlty being \nbedeviled by the media, men not being allowed to show emotion, the list \ngoes on and on.\n\nThis is why I always hate it when I see women here commenting "Oh, so \nyou\'re complaining about having to approach a girl first? Well, we have to \ndeal with this, this, this and that."\n\nJust because women have serious issues, doesn\'t mean that guy\'s issues \nshould be forgotten and get unadressed.\n\nThe reason Ryan made these harmless examples was because his channel is \nwatched by a lot of children. Obviously he wouldn\'t talk about such dark \nissues as rape and domestic violence.\n\nI think the message of this video is: "Both sexes have issues, both sexes \nhave the same responsibilities, let\'s not only focus on *one* gender to \nachieve equality", and that\'s a good message. He might not have had the \nbest examples to back it up, but his point comes through for me and I don\'t \nsee why so many women would get offended at this. What Ryan is talking \nabout here is true equality, and if you as a feminist only see women\'s \nissues like about 80% of girls in this comment section, you have your \nanswer why modern feminism is so disliked in today\'s time. To me, equalism \nis the way to go. Taking care of *both* genders should be the new priority \nbecause *both* genders have serious issues, not just women.\n\nAnd yes, I\'m a girl. Just saying for those who won\'t take my comment \nseriously because "Men have absolutely NO idea what women are going \nthrough".\xef\xbb\xbf'

I mean who, the FUCK gives a shit if it\'s a girl or a guy, if \nthe job provided is the same at the end? but some people can\'t see beyond \nthe gender for some reason. idk about you, but that\'s what I\'ve got to \nwitness\nand that\'s not the only place when you can see girls get a lot more than \nguys, just because of the gender. I think that\'s because girls are way too \ndramatic like you said Ryan, and make so much drama over stuff, they get it \nall, but man give so little shit about arguing about stupid stuff like \nthat, that they just whatever it... but the result is, man are treated like \ntrash everywhere.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p216
aS'Ergh, you bring up good points, but the whole "sensitivity" thing is \nsomething I have to disagree on. Catcalling is something women have to go \nthrough basically every day of our lives. And when we complain we\'re told \nwhat to wear and not to wear so this will be avoided- the cat callers won\'t \nbe told to stop saying offensive things. And there is a reverse- I\'m not \nsaying this only applies to women, but it doesn\'t affect how men can live \ntheir lives like it does to women.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS' (This video def represents in amusing terms, some of them). I just tried \nto in the politest of ways explain why honking and shouting at random men \nwith fake catcalls in a charade to bring attention to not catcalling is \nharassing random men and not going to advance your point. It was basically \n"two wrongs don\'t make a right and people who catcall aren\'t even going to \nget your point". That turned into poor harassed men, it is only once and \nthey are lucky since she was desirable--the last statement expressing \ngender arrogance.  That is a common childish response by some feminists who \ncan\'t even discuss a method some are using to make a point without becoming \nabrasive.

Every commercial or sitcom (Especially ones about \nMarried Couples) always has it to where the Husband/Males looks like \ncomplete Morons. The typical "Moral of the Story" in these shows are "If I \ndon\'t do what my Wife says, Even if I don\'t like it, She\'ll disown me and \nI\'ll be treated like a Scum" Mass Media makes fun of Men all the time and \nwe don\'t even notice it. I mean really, What the fuck is a "Mr.Mom?" \nThey\'re Feminizing Men in the "Process" Notice Homosexuals are getting \nYounger and Younger! (No Offense to Gays) Today\'s Feminists seek "World \nDomination" in a sense. They want Women to make just as much "Money" as Us, \nHave just as much "Power" as US, And have just as much "Authority" as Us. \nBut, It\'s more more Women than Men in the World, So what would that mean? \nFeminizing Us Men and leaving us all the "Secondary" Roles in Life?

I hope I have not offended \nanyone by voicing this opinion as that was certainty not my intention.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'More off the pills videos plz!! This one is great!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p324
aS"Their are many flaws when it comes to feminist equality stuff when you play \nvideo games as much as me you find it that men will swarm a girl that just \nwants attention that really is a guy that loves role playing as a girl you \nknow what I think I just lost the point there but to all you gamers that \nunderstand or others who also understand you can see my point of view if \nyou don't trust me then go onto WoW and get a girl account\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'God your channel is hilarious\xef\xbb\xbf'
p326
aS'hey ryan can you make some more off the pill there really funny and they \nmake you think. come on bro just do it\xef\xbb\xbf'
p327
aS'This is soo true haha\xef\xbb\xbf'
p328
aS'Ryan, being a feminist does not mean you are just "pro girls". Feminism is \nabout equality, both for men and women. If it\xef\xbb\xbf'
p329
aS'he does have a point...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p330
aS"Women should have the same rights as men. But we can't be totally equal \nbecause we're just different. I like it when a guy opens the door for me, \nI've never tried opening a door for a guy though... There are advantages \nbeing a girl, or being a boy. One is not superior to the other, aaaaaaaaand \nthat's it.\nYou're cute, you can get a girlfriend whatever you say. (I know guys like \nbeing called cute as much as girls do. ^^)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p331
aS"Lucky for you, Ryan Higa, that's exactly what feminists want. We want to \nget rid of gender roles (you know, those things that make you open the door \nand get her gifts) meaning that anyone could act like anything they want \nand not be called girly or manly. You basically just described a problem in \nfeminism that only exists in the minds of non-feminists. Btw, you should \nbecome a feminist. It's ok for a man to be pro-women's rights. :D\xef\xbb\xbf"
p332
aNaS"I completely agree with this. I'm a female and I prefer to be treated like \na guy. Can't say that's made me very popular though XD I guess people get \nfreaked out by a girl who doesn't act much like one :/ Anyways, yeah, \nthat's what annoys me about a lot of girls; they want equality but what \nthey really mean is they want to be privileged. They want to be treated \nequal but they still want the door opened for them.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p333
aS'Feminist only about having the same right just as man did. Rights and \nresponsibility are a different matter. Some women fight for their rights, \nsome other fights to throw the traditional responsibility. that is why i \ndon\'t believe equality is the right words to approach this problem. A \nsimple point for an example is that biologically and generally, man are \nphysically stronger and bigger than women. How can there be "equality" for \nthose two differently build human?? So in my opinion, feminism are only \nabout getting equal rights, but not throwing away responsibility. So you \ncan works as much as you want, but your body decides that you were the one \nthat will carry the baby for 9 months not the male. Paid the same, but have \nmore needs and and leaves? How is that equal? \xef\xbb\xbf'
p334
aS'well, boobs are\nprivate parts, while muscles?\nI\'m pretty sure I guy would be offended if I girl said "you have a nice \npenis" I\'m just saying girls get offended at all the right things. \xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'You forgot an intro...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p336
aS"I agree Ryan!! :) you're so cute too..\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'in the end, men get most of the crap. but if women want equality, trust me, \nwe would love that\xef\xbb\xbf'
p338
aS"Open a door for a girl and she thinks you're trying to flirt! Get over \nyourself!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p339
aS"Are you all sure about the definition of feminism? Feminism is the same as \ngender equality. We do not put men down, but we put women as the same level \nas men. We are feminists because we break the rule of how women and men \nshould be, and we put both genders on equal pedestals. Women only want to \nbe treated equally, and not as a tool, a sexual organ or somebody who's \nsupposed to be in the kitchen. Our salary is almost always lower than men, \neven if we both work the same job in the same field. Feminism means no slut \nshaming, no body shaming, and we view men as equal partners, not our \ndominants. And for your information, even men can be feminists. No, they \nare not gay. They are just more well educated people who recognized the \nimbalance in the levels of men and women. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p340
aS'... when ever I hang out with my friends (3) they are all guys. but its \nlike this : one dousnt care at all, the other is a perv but only to be \nfunny, and the therd one is my boyfriend... so yea... I kinda got used to \nnot going shoping, and doing girly things...\xef\xbb\xbf'

p345
aS"And also, it's different when it's like, a guy has to open the door and pay \nfor dinner if they don't want to look like a douche, but it's different \nbecause in some places girls can't get a education, and can't drive just \nbecause we're girls.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p346
aS"well maybe because guys don't have periods and don't deliver baby that's \nwhy they need to treat girl with more importance LOL XD \n\nNow let's talk about equality\n\n(Not offended though, believe me)\n(and Yes.. I love playing Video Games too XD)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p347
aS"Amazing video :D and yeah I'm a girl and I think girls are really Stupid \nsometimes XP\xef\xbb\xbf"
p348
aS"This video make so much sense! I hate how it's considered polite to open a \ndoor for a woman or pay for a meal or whatever. All relationships should be \nbuilt on equality, and doings things for women that they are fully capable \nof doing themselves is, in my mind, a form of sexism, and what annoys me \neven more is that it's irregular for a woman to do such things for a man.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"no, shut the fuck up, you really truly don't understand feminism if you \ndon't know why i should be offended. if your girlfriend really bothers you \n*that much* break the fuck up with her, if she doesn't wanna ride your \ngoddamn slab of meat every time you buy her chocolates then she doesn't \nhave to. yeah she'll cry and sob if you break up with her, but you poor \nfragile boys wouldn't have to deal with opening the door and getting a hug \nfor a gift in return right?

p369
aS"Boobs and muscles don't even fit in the same category!"
p370
aS'In "truth" that is NOT what feminism is about. It\'s called feminism because \nthe number one goal is to get rid of patriarchy and empower females because \nwomen are being oppressed. But just because some women call themselves \n"feminists" while saying they should have more power than men, doesn\'t mean \nthat they ARE feminists. And the ones who actually hate men: call them \nfeminazis. That\'s what we call them. Feminism is about equality. It\'s not \nso hard to understand.'

aS"I couldnt agree more! I took Women's Studies classes 3 years in a row \n(because I support equality and thought I was a 'feminist') and each year I \njust wanted to kill myself. Modern feminism has nothing to do with \nequality. "

p385
aS'As for the spouse abuse, people generally react more strongly to females \nabuse victims because it has been a core belief in past generations that \nwomen are delicate and need protection. This is not really true, but it \ntakes time to change something that our society was built upon. Like how \nwomen are branded sluts, whereas men are free to roam. Clearly sexism \nexists for both sexes. But for change, the needs of both genders need to be \naddressed without making the one out to be the bad guy. '

aS' how did you jump to biology :D , girl don\'t get personal, because that \nwill be whole another battle. Now I don\'t like a word feminism,and don\'t \ncare about it, understand the concept of it, and there will be no need to \ndebate over something that is crystal clear. You think in "modern" world \nit\'s all good, that\'s simply wrong, I told you by examples :D what is going \non in the modern world, if you don\'t see it that\'s your problem.'
p391
aS'Are you serious? How the fuck are woman living in a "patriachy"? Men don\'t \nhold any authority over women and children. In fact, it is a solely a \nwoman\'s choice on whether to keep a child and men are usually always fucked \nif they want the child. I think you radical feminist just like to play the \nvictim. '
p392
aS'Yes, I agree, the points you mentioned are arguable. Yet I think that \n"womanizer" is overall not an insult. At least I don\'t think that I know \nanyone who would feel insulted by being called a womanizer. Also the word \nisn\'t used nearly as much as "slut", especially in the context of clothes \netc.'

aS"And (though I'm not sure how often this actually happens) if women were \ncaptured as war prisoners... what do you think will happen to them? Women \nwill be sexually tortured, and while male prisoners are raped as well, it \nis mainly a tool to assert dominance, and it will be much more dangerous \nfor them. For males, it isn't a guarantee that they will be raped \n(probably, though), but if it were a woman.... oh boy, it would DEFINITELY \nhappen ALL the time, ANY time."
p411
aS"Equal pay is NOT given. It gets closer to being equal, but it's not. It's \neven worse for women of color. In Europe alone the wage gap is still 25+ %. \nEqual rights? Not exactly. In many cases men get a heavier sentence than \nwomen would get in the same situation. But there are also cases where women \nsuffer oppression regarding laws. For example: The recent anti-abortion \nlaws. A woman isn't allowed to back out of a pregnancy, but men are. They \ncan just leave without consequences."

aS'lol'
p420
aS"Because in our society it's usually women who aren't given equal rights in \nregards to gender equality. Of course, we usually have it better than, say, \ntransgender people, but the concept was/is often called women's suffrage or \nwomen's rights, so it was called feminism."
p421
aS'The problem is, is that you shouldn\'t want to be accepted as woman. You \nshould want to be accepted as a human being. In reality, we are all equal. \nExcept, as you said, things such as "patriarchy" stand in the way of this.'
p422
aS"The truth is it does matter in our society if you are male or female. Men \ncannot be impregnated against their will. Women's oppression is based on \nmen's violence and sadism and women's vulnerability to it biologically. "

aS'The definition and the reality are unfortunately two very separate things. \nFirst wave feminism - a noble, legitimate enterprise fighting for equality \nbetween men and women (the right to vote, the right to work, etc). second \nwave feminism - slightly more redundant, and focused on the social aspect, \nsince legally speaking, women have the same rights at this point. Third \nwave feminism - completely redundant. "well, we have equal rights, but I \nstill feel like bitching about something".'

aS"Also, like I said before, all men were expected to work because women UNDER \nLAW were not allowed to. But don't get me wrong- sexism goes both ways and \nI think it's fucked up that men are expected to constantly put their lives \non the line because they're physically stronger. We see how badly it screws \nup the mentality of the young male veterans. Sexism doesn't do any favours \nand men deserve a break as well."
p432
aS'Because "equality" + "special treatment" don\'t go together, if guys are \nexpected to open, hold doors or pay for dinner then women are expected to \nstay home with the baby. And what exactly is treating a girl like a bro? \nWhats the definition of that? There is none, because it\'s all SOCIAL \nstructure that built to that.

aS"It's a double standard. But in general people find violence funny. The only \nreason that if it's a guy slapping a girl it's usually not considered funny \nis because we're taught that guys shouldn't hit girls.

p443
aS"That is true, labour work was more dangerous a century ago. Sorry for \nwaving that off. But my main point remains that the difficulty of the work \nhad little to nothing to do with why women wanted to work. An example; \nNearly a century ago, women had to take up the jobs of men during the world \nwars; factory work, operating heavy machinery and building weapons. Not \neasy work, definitely dangerous. When the war ended and governments began \nrevoking women's work, many were passionately against it. "

aS'I am also talking about lower classes. Also note, "easy" is not the same as \n"safe." Do some research about the women who were expected to work in the \ntextile mills in the nineteenth century and tell me that that shit was safe \nand easy. Also, it\'s interesting you mention mines, because whenever wars \nbroke out, the majority of people working in the mines were wives and \nsisters.

p476
aS"You realize I can say the exact same thing about social work or nursing? \nIt's MOSTLY about life choices. The fact remains , the amount of women \nbeing opressed because they're women in modern countries is LOW. You're \ndisgusting, you know why? Because there IS inequality against men, and \nfeminism COMPLETELY ignores that, it's so hypocritical. "
p477
aS'I totally agree with everything you said in this vid. Im a girl, I didnt \nthink that this was offensive'
p478
aS'in the third world countries they are fighting just for survival okey? when \nyou get pass that, and advance like women of "modern" world you face \nobstacles, in your way that aren\'t in men\'s way, and you think that\'s not \nfair. That\'s what we want, everything to be fair, between both sexes, what \ndo you not get? when man is tough ,opinionated and decisive he\'s sexy, when \na woman is tough , opinionated and decisive she\'s a bitch do you not see \nthat that\'s not right or fair?

(no for real, I'm \ntaking you seriously but your name could be a stigma for you, watch out \nlol) Second: Physically you're right about that, sure. And mentally and \nemotionally there are (usually) some differences too. But the point is: The \nlaw system should be equal. Everything regarding jobs should be equal. \nEVERY SINGLE RIGHT should be equal. It's not about the body or who should \nbe able to punch who (don't fucking punch anybody jfc)."

p487
aS"Yet girls are the ones people feel sorry for, that people stand up for if \nthey get abused or want custody. Guys get abused, guys can be better \nparents, but no, girl power, yeah? If a girl slaps a guy in public, they're \nhaving a tiff. If a guy slap a girl, ABUSE. Sexism exists on both ends. \nEven millenia ago, people act like being a woman was like Hell, ignoring \nthe fact that they often got to stay at home, while guys worked/fought for \nthe family. Now jobs are easy, so more girls want them."

aS'yes, a thousand times YES!'

aS"Because employers don't legally have to pay every one of their employees \nthe exact same amount, and for good reason. If they were required to do so, \nthat shithead who shows up to work and sleeps at his desk would be getting \npaid the same amount as the start employee. It's painful for some people to \nrealize this but just because men make an average of $1.07 for every $1.00 \nwomen earn does not inherently imply sexism. It implies that men are better \nemployees."
p493
aS"Looks like you got me! You might want to check on that one. I'm relatively \ncertain both conjugations are acceptable."
p494
aS"Anyone can be a feminist tho, it's not just girls!"
p495
aS"Equality doesn't mean the same. Guys don't have to do those things but it \ndepends on who you date cus some girls are traditionalists and some are \nfeminists and some believe you should just treat people as people and \nnothing less"

aS'The whole buying things for your girlfriend is a very interesting thing. In \nstraight relationships the guy is expected to pay but as a'
p497
aS"I don't quite understand what you are trying to say here. It's spelt \nsalary. Yes, I would say that I am a feminist and if it weren't for the \ncultural pollution of the term, I think a lot of other people would too. I \ndon't believe that I stipulated at any point that women 'want privileges'. \nIn fact, I said quite the opposite. Feminists want equality. We don't need \nyou to open doors or pay for lunch - this is a silly cultural expectation \nplaced on men. Feminism is for all genders."
p498
aS'All the inequalities nigahiga mentioned come from patriarchy, too. Men are \nexpected to hold open doors for women, because in a patriarchy, women are \nthought of as being weak. Keep supporting feminism!'
p499
aS'Dear Ryan, Take yo shirt off.'
p500
aS"Feminists are now asking for men not to open doors or buy dinner for women \nbecause it treats females as the weaker sex who are always dependent on \nguys to help them. I know Ryan is exaggerating for comedy but a lot of what \nhe's saying seems to be what a lot of people are thinking. Try talking to a \nfeminist in real life, not getting stereotypes from internet memes. Anyone \nwho believes women should get equal pay is a feminist. After all, we don't \nask blacks to act white for the sake of equal pay."
p501
aS'This video is really accurate Ryan :)'
p502
aS'I would play video games with you haha'
p503
aS'ok true but if he stated the bull shit you just said in this video do you \nreally think he would be 6.5 million views?'
p504
aS'This is awesome, thanks for supporting equality! :-)'
p505
aS'Feminists exist because "this is a man\'s man\'s world". No, in my opinion \nthere should be many many feminists around the world,if you don\'t get why \nit\'s very easy to give you " little fucking clue".How many woman CEO\'s do \nyou see.Big companies Coca cola, Apple and many more, they do not have \nwoman CEOs.In thousans of big companies around the globe from thousand \nthere will be probably 10 women CEOs. How many woman presidents do you see \nin the world that comprises 196 countries, may be one or two..'
p506
aS'Ryan\'s like "this video isn\'t gonna help me get a girlfriend" but he has \nlike a million fan girls asking him out... Silly Ryan....!'
p507
aS'FACT'
p508
aS'Dear Ryan, can you play soccer?'
p509
aS'Feminism is: "Girls who seek equality between men and women." Yeah, right. \nOh Nigahiga, if only you knew what feminism actually does you wouldn\'t be \nsaying that. In fact, it\'d be great if you actually researched what they do \nand what misconceptions they operate under.'
p510
aS'almost nothing about this sentence makes sense im really sorry'
p511
aS"And all that can be backed up just watch a movie who's starring a women 9 x \nout of 10 she slaps at least 2 guys in public"
p512
aS'WOMEN ARE EQUAL TO MEN. They\'re not the same, but just because 2 things are \nnot the same doesn\'t mean that one is superior to the other. Also, I \nbelieve the word "feminism" is depicted the wrong way by a lot of \npeople...like only extremists are the only ones who are ACTUALLY feminists. \nNot true. Just wanting gender equality makes you a feminist yourself. So \nyes, there are guy feminists. And I think they\'re awesome. Which makes you, \nRyan Higa, a feminist. You\'re way awesome now more than ever!'
p513
aS"That's true! I watched a movie once, and this woman pushed her husband (who \nwas in a wheelchair) into a bathtub. She didn't even help him out until he \npassed out. And she purposely caused physical harm to him! I think he \nshould've punched her. But if a woman DOESN'T deserve it, then its abuse."
p514
aS"I've asked out over 20 guys in my life :P"
p515
aS'I complain about the same sex... Girls are annoying!!'
p516
aS'Feminism has changed the society to feel a total contempt for men who are \nnot instantly useful to women. The word "Women need men like a fish needs a \nbicycle" comes from feminists. Look at this: watch?v=kkmanLIAdXI They got \naway with an apology where they where struggling not to ROFL again. Now \nimagine 4 men cheering and making fun of a woman who\'s husband took a hand \nheld kitchen blender and shoved it into her vagina until it ripped her \nuterus to slices. what do you think would happen ? '
p517
aS'The fact you think it\'s okay to threaten or use your fists because someone \njoked with you shows how ridicilous feminism is. I\'d like to see where a \nman says that if a girl tells him a sexist remark he\'ll punch her with his \n"powerful fists". Double standards. '

aS'your the man of the relationship '
p526
aS"Look, I recognize that your period is awful, with mood swings and pain. \nHowever, now imagine waking up everyday with a different part of your body \nfeeling sore because it shot up overnight, like one of your arms suddenly \ngrowing longer or your chest.That's what its like on most days for a guy's \npuberty: growth spurts. Now imagine being filled with hormones that make \nyou insanely turned on, and combine that with being the gender that \neveryone ALREADY thinks is a perv. That is a guy's puberty."
p527
aS'i totally agree not hitting each other!!! i don\'t believe that in any way \nsomeone should have the "right" to do something bad just because "they\'re a \ngirl" or complain about stuff they do too. i want equality. but you have to \nadmit that a man hitting a woman and a woman hitting a man is not nearly \nthe same thing! yes there are some strong women and some weak men but let\'s \nbe honest generallly it\'s the man who is strong enough to carry a woman \naround in his arms and not the other way around.'

aS'Modern day feminists suck ass... and yes, I am putting down a LOT of my \ngender.... fuck women are annoying...'

aS'Yes, and black women and hispanic women make even less on average. I am not \nlooking for sympathy at all. But everyone should be AWARE of the oppression \nwomen suffer because of the patriarchy. Racial oppression is another \nterrible thing, but we are talking about sexism here, aren\'t we? Because \nthat\'s the no. 1 thing feminists are fighting against. Maybe you should \ncheck something out called the "male privilege checklist".'

p554
aS'continued from my first comment: 10) men receive a lot of flak for being \ndeadbeats, or leaving their families 14/15) While this is very true, it \nrarely benefits me in anyway. I haven\'t seen an elected official in my \nlifetime that has done anything competent, or benefitted me personally. 24) \nThe male term is called being a "womanizer", which is arguably worse \nbecause of its malicious connotation. 43) statistically inaccurate. There \nare a few more but for the most part, I agree with the list.'

p556
aS"Women are not equal to men..but who's to say that the inequality is pro \nman..men and women bring separate things to the table..that's the beauty.."
p557
aS"That's not what equality means to me. & I don't think it's the most \nimportant thing, & it's not the thing I want the most, just one of them. \nThis is why: According to society, I can hit both genders because I've got \na coin slot in front of my ass, but a guy can't hit me, even if I'm being a \ncomplete bitch, simply because he's got something hanging between his legs? \nThat never seemed right to me. But that's just me, so let it go. -_-"

What I hate is the fact that you people are being so butt hurt over \nsomething that was a simple statement that should have been my own \npersonal, non offensive opinion that I have the right to post without being \ncrucified for it! Now please, shut the fuck up & leave me alone."

p569
aS"I'm a girl and I honestly agree! "

p580
aS"Feminism? Oh, you mean The Women's Liberation Movement. Which leaves little \ndoubt of what it's about. Women's liberation from men and their system.

aS"1) It is not acceptable to hit anyone regardless of who they are. 2) A \nmillennium ago, women weren't allowed to work. They weren't allowed to \nvote. They weren't allowed to have an education. Granted, men were expected \nto work which is absolutely horrible, people should be allowed to do what \nthey want to do.

p627
aS"Ok that's not wrong and its not right, feminism is the belief that women \nare equal or superior to men. Im going to look at this from a biblical \nstand point so flag for spam if you want or dislike but here me out first. \npart of Eves curse is that women would be forced to serve men until the \nSecond coming. Now lets look at it from an evolutionary stand point the \nfemale have evolved to procreate and raise children and take care of the \nmale while the male hunts and gathers food."
p628
aS'I think people see the word feminism and roll their eyes because feminism \nis such a vague term. The difference in view points between feminists is \nextreme to say the least. In valerie Solanas\' "scum manifesto", she says \nthat men should be exterminated and we should use cloning technology to \ncreate an all female society. Disturbingly enough, a lot of "radfems" agree \nwith her. Those are unfortunately the people that come to mind when you say \nthe word feminism, to some people at least.'

aS'Okay that\'s true in many places, but you generalized EVERYTHING as if they \nwere facts... Not everyone has that logic so the way you are saying it \nmakes absolutely no sense.

aS"Hm, I only agree with some parts of this video. I will say this, though: \ntrue feminists do believe in equal rights, and the problems you named, such \nas guys having to pay for dinner, are caused by patriarchy, which is \nessentially the idea that a guy has to be the one in control and that \nimplies that a woman shouldn't have to do something like pay for her own \ndinner because she has to be provided for. Personally, I just think that \nit's common courtesy to always assume you're paying for yourself."

aS"It's unfair either way, but which is less fair? If bearing a child were \neasy and not incredibly biologically expensive, time-consuming, and \nemotional, you might have a point. At the end of the day, it's WAY easier \nfor a man to have his own kid - no comparison. Even menstruation is \nexpensive. Can you answer my previous question about the ones in power? How \nare they empowered?"
p812
aS'My real argument on "my mind, my body, my choice" is that it\'s existence is \nto protect "sex is not an agreement to parenthood" but where is the LEGAL \nfatherhood abortion? He doesn\'t have to be a father to the child, but if \nthe mother wants to, she can have that man paying for it, against his will, \nbut isn\'t sex not an agreement to parenthood? "He should of kept it in his \npants", well why isn\'t it "she should of kept her legs closed" when women \nwants an abortion?'

p822
aS'I agree about the whole asking out thing. Everyone needs to cut the \nbullcrap. If you like somebody, just tell them'
p823
aS"Neither... they are feminists. I see your point. Women's rights are only a \npart of feminism; it's more about gender roles in society and how they \naffect individuals and groups. We still call it feminism because the root \nproblem is the same and it's evolved from an earlier movement that got us \nto this stage. But maybe this word alienates the average person, and turns \nuniversal issues into women's issues - which also absolves everyone else of \nresponsibility. "
p824
aS'Yes, the man does not have to carry or birth the child, but when women have \n100% control over their pregnancy, there should be no such thing as an \n"accidental pregnancy"(there should also be no reason the man wouldn\'t know \nshe has gotten pregnant). When this happens, you can\'t expect the man to \njust accept not getting to be a father, because of the irresponsible \nchoices the woman made, that got her pregnant. '
p825
aS"I'm not a feminist, because of the connotations of no bras, which I don't \nagree with. I'm just for human rights that's all."
p826
aS'It is unfair either way, but it is not easy for man to have a child, when \nhe has to depend on a woman, to make it so, unless you go the stem cell \nroute(unlikely). Well I never really said anything about women having \npower, but "my body, my choice" do give them power. Like I said, the women \nnow have the power to decide the fate of a potential life and fatherhood. \nIf the man doesn\'t commit, she then have the power to make him commit \nfinancially. '
p827
aS"It's a tricky argument and I see your point, though I don't agree that a \nwoman should ever be forced to bear a child because a man wants one. That's \nher say - but I agree on the responsibility bit. What if two people are \nsafe, but an accident happens that the man doesn't want? I honestly don't \nthink he should have to pay. Of course, the law predates the wide \navailability of birth control."
p828
aS"Giving her full say, is saying that she can take what's half of a man's and \ndispose of it, even if he doesn't approves. She only owns half of the \nfetus, the other half is the man's, and if she wasn't raped by the man, \nthen he deserves a fair say. My thoughts: Both wants it, keep it. She wants \nit, she take full responsibility of it. Neither wants it, abort it. He \nwants it, and the woman would be at no EXTRA risk of death or disease from \na normal pregnancy, then she should hand it over at birth."
p829
aS"Yes the argument is tricky, and I don't expect anyone to actually agree \nwith me, but I know no one can honestly deny the unfairness of being put in \nthe situation where a woman gets pregnant, and not ready to commit to \nparenthood, but the father is, and he gets absolutely no say in the unborn \nchild's fate, even though 50% of it's DNA belongs to him."
p830
aS"WOW... dude, this is so totally a bad idea. You started a whole \ndiscussion... and guess what? When my boyfriend treats me like a dude, that \nautomatically means there is going to be revenge... IN THE FORM OF \nPRANKS!!!!!!!!! Yeah, I'm immature, but it's better than being a douchebag \nand being mad or whatever."

p832
aS"Feminism IS needed when you're talking about third world countries , \nhowever, they're not dealing with issues there, the majority of feminist \nmovements are in MODERN countries where they're less needed. I'm sorry to \ntell you but 50% of something doesn't mean equality, women and men prefer \ndifferent stuff without relation to inequality, 50% in everything means \nthere is a MASSIVE amount of inequality. It's biology, get educated."

aS'It is a psychology fact that if men and and women are doing the same job \nwith the same effort and quality, the female will more likely be considered \ndoing less then the guy and blamed for wrongs.. It\'s just a community. \nWell, if it was considered more right, I\'d definitely prefer to ask out \nguys. Also.. How come there are such insults, even in school, as "act like \na girl", "so girlish", "be a dude, man, not a little girl".. Also, starting \nan argument - bad. And I am a guy, not a girl-feminist. '

aS"I believe it's called a masculinist."

aS'Very true'
p847
aS'Women don\'t have to be thin, or tiny, or have no muscle, or have thing legs \nand arms, or have giant breasts. They just decide to have those because \nthey either feel insecure about themselves. Notice how I said "decide". Any \ngirl can decide not to. If they have what it takes to change and like it, \nthey will also have what it takes defend themselves when they are bullied. \nNot generalizing female population, just those people who think like \nnyancat.'

p853
aS"Jobs, in general, ARE easier now. Look, say, 100 years back. Most jobs are \nmanual labour - dangerous, tiring. There were few desk jobs, especially for \nlower classes. Now, most jobs, while more intellectual, require much less \nphysical work, or risk. They are, in effect, easier. I do agree that we \ncan't make one gender out to be the bad guy. Currently, that 'bad guy' is \noften the male. People need to realise that past discrimination isn't an \nexcuse for giving females more leeway than males now."

p858
aS"I'd go through all that just to shut people like you up. No one forces you \nto be pregnant, so what are you on about?"
p859
aS"Um, why not? Feminists wants both genders to be equal, not just the female \ngender. I've seen many videos on youtube and blog posts by men who are \nfeminists."
p860
aS"I have to disagree. I don't know where you're from, but I've never seen a \ngirl mistreated or made fun of due to her sex. You're only treated like \ntotal crap if you let some asshole treat you like total crap. Girls get \npretty much all the attention, get free shit, can punch guys without the \nfear of getting punched back (I've seen this so many times, esp. in \nschool), can act like total jerks and get away with it, and even the law \nfavor women (in the US at least)."

p873
aS'I totally agree. In addition to all the points you made, I have another. \nThis one really bothers me. Well, there are really two of them. If a guy \ncalls a girl a b****, the girl will do all sorts of things, but then, they \njust call a guy a d*** and think that it is fine. Also, there is "Don\'t hit \nme, I\'m a girl." So because you are a girl, I can\'t hit you, but because I \nam a guy, you can hit me as much as you want? These are just some things \nthat really bother me about feminists. '

p883
aS"Feminism is the reason women are total slutty cunts these days with no \nmoral values or self worth. Reason why divorce rate is over 50%, and reason \nwhy men go overseas to find decent women. Reason why women hate the fact \nthat they are women. Feminism is nothing but the delusion that men and \nwomen can be equal, which created the gender war that destroyed the nuclear \nfamily. Women didn't vote because they didn't pay taxes and didn't fight in \nwars, in fact most males didn't have the right to vote."

aS"You're right, it can easily be abused, but what needs to be done is raising \nawareness. Legally speaking though, nothing else can change short of \nbecoming communist where everyone gets paid the same amount. In a \ncapitalist society, it is statistically impossible for every single person \nto get paid equally, even in a perfectly discrimination free world. And for \nthe record, white women make 8% more than black men and 15% more than \nhispanic men, so forgive my lack of sympathy for you."
p891
aS'I never had anyone (if that\'s what you meant), and honestly, I don\'t know \nwhat are you on about. I just found that so many people look at having \n"someone" as a norm.

I asked a question, and you start to make \nassumptions about me, and saying things that some peope could even consider \nan insult. I don\'t give a shit, but stop.

p892
aS'Xanthe, women enjoy benefits of patriarchy too, a woman can ask a man to \npay for her. women can stay back to raise a child. women can live off her \nhusband. women are benefited in the court. Patriarchy is a problem, \nfeminists claim to fight against that, but when it comes to benefits, they \njust whistle and say well erm we get it because of patriarchy, it is fault \nof men and move along saying well, erm i didnt do it. Patriarchy is not the \nfault of men alone, that is what feminists refuse to hear .'
p893
aS'I completely agree!! I\'ve been trying to explain this point of view to \nother girls for years, but very few are open to listen to it. A common \nresponse is, \'Well we should get equal rights because that\'s obviously \nfair! And we have doors opened for us and meals bought for us \'cause.. \nthats just how it is!"

I mean, surely you heard about what happened in Texas \nwith the whole abortion thing... Why is that still going on? Fair enough, \nwe will always be different, we will always have characteristics which will \nsuit one thing or another... But we're not talking about that kind of \nequal.

p902
aS"As a woman, I feel that men have to put up with a lot of rubbish from \nwomen. My point of view is that men and women are equal but different. It \nis kind of strange to me when some women want to do everything men do (yet \nfor example if it involves lifting heavy things they can't carry the same \nload).

p976
aS"Objects of desire* Not sex objects, there is a difference. Just as a man \nwith his shirt off is an object of desire. It's inappropriate for women to \ngo topless, because women and men alike claim the exposure of breast as \nnudity, even though it's not. If it was, then the exposure of a man's chest \nshould be considered nudity given that the only differences between the two \nis the amount of fatty tissue and muscle that consist in them and that \nwomen hold more milk in theirs."

aS'It\'s called "feminism" because it began in the 1800s with suffragettes for \nthe vote. Today\'s version of feminism recognises that men don\'t profit from \nsexism/gender roles. One of feminism\'s key ideas is that society considers \n"feminine" traits negative and "masculine" traits positive - when a girl \nplays video games, she\'s cool, but when a guy stays at home to care for \nkids, he\'s a loser. This viewpoint leads to homophobia, too. It\'s ignorant \nto say feminism is only for women.'
p980
aS'the thing is, the world is still sexist, girls are still treated as the \nfragile sex, being raped and beaten up. As to less dramatic circumstances, \nthey still get less money and when a couple is traveling by car,most of \ntimes the boy drives it. So,most girls grow up being taught that they are \nweak and need a strong man to protect them and pay everything for her,i \nagree this is wrong but the are not to blame...'

p987
aS"Like slaves, women used to be property, and their treatment as such \nsometimes continues today. It's true that most women reading this are lucky \nenough to only be discriminated against, not oppressed. Your view of \nfeminism seems outdated. The face of feminism today is, in fact, less \nradical than before, and very much focuSsed on how gender inequality \naffects BOTH sexes. "
p988
aS"Actually, yes. I know several males who are feminists (the ones who \nactually understand it). Most women I know don't want to be associated with \nfeminism."
p989
aS"Do you understand that in the world, there are many countries in the world \nsweetheart, many, there are no women president do you know what that means \nyou .... world is run by men you ... so until 50 % of the world isn't run \nby women, you see i didn't say 100% sweety, just 50. until then I don't \ngive a ... about men's inequality "

aS"it's called chivalry man. Woman bear children and suffer for nine months to \nbring you and me to the world. Men holding open doors for woman is a stereo \ntype. not all men do that, I do that more than most men I've seen. Were \nmore emotional than men that's all there is too it."
p991
aS"I see you bought into society's myth that feminism is outdated. No it's \nnot. Women have come along way but there is still along way to go. No men \nand women don't have the same rights as men on paper b/c if we did, sex \ndiscrimination would not still exist today. Women's reproductive rights \nwould not be under attack and women would be paid for the same work as men \nwhich includes the same amount of experience, hours worked, etc. I could go \non an d on but don't have the energy to go more in depth"
p992
aS"It's not a good idea for women to be in the army because the average woman \nis simply NOT physically, mentally, or emotionally qualified to perform \nwell in combat situations. I am a female, and I know male family members \nwho have been in combat (the Vietnam/Korean wars for example) and they all \ntell me the same damn thing: WAR. IS. HELL. You can't even IMAGINE the \nhorrors of watching your buddy's head getting blown off right in front of \nyou. "
p993
aS'As usual, the original feminists had it right. Equal pay and equal respect \nshould be given. Modern feminists, however, act like women are treated so \npoorly in this country. In reality, they pretty much have control over men. \n"You\'re supposed to pull my chair out, hold the door for me, pay for me and \nbe nice to me no matter what... while treating me like an equal."

Every right \nhas a responsibility attached. If women want more rights, they should get \nmore responsibilities, too."

p1074
aS"Why name something that's for gender equality as feminism? I tell you why, \nbecause the point of feminism is to increase women's rights (so that they \nwould be equal), and ignore the problems on the other side. Don't get me \nwrong, I'm for equal rights, but I will never call myself a feminist.

I do agree with the idea of women \nshouldn\'t be ashamed to go shirtless, because breast aren\'t "private parts" \nas people claim. If they were, so is a man\'s chest.'

aS'Well guys brains are different than girls brains. It\'s a fact. And girls \nare generally softer than guys... Because of the different brains. And \nthings have to be different.

I \nunderstand why it's different because a mans body is built to be stronger \nthan a womans body. Sure, women can be strong too, some are even stronger \nthan guys I'm just saying I understand why the limits are set differently, \nit's not to be demeaning or anything(I ran 6:50 before)Had to restate my \npoint because of some random rude person who misunderstood me^~^"
p1304
aS"asking for an AVERAGE girl to do physical activities at the same level as \nan AVERAGE guy is like asking a man to give birth, as in it would take so \nmuch more work for something that is natural for someone else, that is not \nincluding intelligence or anything like that of course, strictly physical, \ni agree about the hard work and it is possible, but the world just isn't \nequal, we could never change our nature to be equal but we can adjust life \nto be more equal."
p1305
aS"I hate those kind of chicks too, and I am a chick lol. Honestly, if femnism \nis about gender equality, then I'm definetely a feminist, but I want the \nsame RESPONSABILITIES, not just rights as men. I don't want to have to take \nan easier physical test for a specific job because I'm a woman, that's the \nstandard, if you can't make it, then you're out, either you're a man or a \nwoman. Not all aspects of equality are easy, and if you really want it, \nyou'll embrace those too, otherwise you're a hypocrite"

aS"It's alright, sorry then, it's just that I can't always identify \nsarcasm/jokes as such when written, and I think I've dealt with too many \narseholes for the past few days, maybe that's why:P."
p1308
aS'lol it was a joke :) dont take it seriously '
p1309
aS'exactly what ive been saying, girls should treat guys with respect and \nequality like doing things they want to do too, and guys should do the \nsame. some girls expect guys to do everything for them while they dont do \nanything for the guy, and some guys do the same thing. as Ryan said its all \nabout treating each other with equality.'
p1310
aS'I agree with this video completely! Drives me nuts how girls want equality \nand yet refuse to do traditional "male" roles. They just want men to do \ntraditionally "female" roles. It needs to go BOTH ways.'
p1311
aS"But thats just how things work, guys are naturally built to be stronger \nthan girls, like when i was in high school, guys would have to use a \nregular pull up bar, girls would use a modified pull up bar (able to help \nyou lift some of the weight) and why?? because guys are again naturally \nbuilt to be stronger, I'm not saying girls aren't strong or are always less \nstrong than guys, but having the same responsibilities only puts you at a \nunfair disadvantage. "

p1314
aS'agree'
p1315
aS"I hate girls like that that's why I am a tomboy :D treat me like a dude I \ndon't care"
p1316
aS"While I respect your opinion, I tend to disagree. With some physical \ntraining, a woman can have enough strength to pass those tests, and also, \nthe highschool thing may be indeed different, because most men are \nnaturally stronger, but there are always exceptions, so no, I don't think \nit would be an unfair disadvantage. If a woman is willing enough to work \nhard for it, she can do it. That's how equality works, it includes both \nprivileges and responsabilities, and some girls need to understand that"
p1317
aS"Also, no I'm not trolling, I actually mean it, thank you xD "
p1318
aS"Ok, let me ask you this, and this isn't to say your wrong. What would \nhappen if government made a law that said both men and women had same pay \nin salaries. What if women have more maternity leave, should we give women \nthe same yearly salaries. On average, studies show women takes more breaks \nand leaves than men. Men have more production in hands on jobs, because of \ndifferences in body type. "
p1319
aS'Oh wow, this thing has become a forum thread of its own O_o Ah well, it is \nan intriguing topic, and as with most thing intriguing, it tends to be a \nsensitive issue. I think ultimately though, being anything at all comes \nwith both pros and cons. Perhaps what everyone is fighting for is the same \nrespect and same kindness we give others. I try to think about it in the \nsimplest way; to do unto others what you want others to do unto you and to \nreward based on meritocracy.'
p1320
aS"People who write without punctuation annoys me. Plus I was trying to point \nout a flaw wasn't going into an argument. Was making her understand and \ngive a realization for what she was. But then again, It's probably going \nover your head since your probably ******."
p1321
aS"that is not true at all, men who enjoy sex often or with many girls are \noften not respected for it and neither are women like you said, you really \nthink it was like that 2000 years ago?? how the fuck do you know how \nanything was 2000 years ago dumbass your not 2000 years old are you?? \ndidn't think so, a woman ran for president in 2008, queens have been the \nmost powerful people in the world many times, so what the fuck are you \ntalking about??"
p1322
aS'Everybody sins, yet so many religions try so hard to suppress that fact, \nthrough fear tactics of going to hell and such. When a man enjoys sex he is \nconsidered a champion, but when a woman enjoys sex she is considered a \npiece of shit. Now how did that came to be. Its been like that 2000 years \nago, and its still like this today. Thhat aside, there is absolutely \nnothing wrong with women taking power or responsibility, it is just that \nmen are too scared, arrogant or stubborn for that to happen.'
p1323
aS'we go to work every day to bring home money to pay bills, pay for food, \nect. is it really that hard for you to make me a sandwich and do my \nlaundry?? '
p1324
aS"Way to generalize half of the population. So you're saying ONLY men are \nperverts who are corrupt, and woman are the people who can do no wrong? \nThis is as bad as putting women down, which you claim to fight against. "
p1325
aS'You should google it sometime...'
p1326
aS"I understand, and I'm not neccessarily talking about the average girl/guy, \nbut about those cases when if it's a physical test involved, the woman must \nprepare really hard and take it at the same level of difficulty as the man, \nthat's just my opinion. Regarding the physical strength, the genders may \nnot be naturally equal (with some exceptions), but that does not mean that \nwe can't embrace equality as the universal truth it is, but equality goes, \nof course, both ways and some tend forget that... "
p1327
aS'no society sees women as pure angels, or anyone as pure angels for that \nmatter, dumbass.'
p1328
aS"Wait a second, you want equality for women and men yet it isn't fair when \nmen and women are given the same tasks? I don't know why you cannot see the \nhypocrisy and irony in your statement."
p1329
aS"Most employers would stop hiring women because we'd have the same salaries \nyet women produce less. The feminists would then have ask the government to \nimplement a law saying that the jobs have to be 50:50 in gender ratio or \ntheir company/corporation/institution is sexist. This is fundamental \neconomics. Anyways women may get their laws passed but very unlikely due to \nvery communistic ideas which is not part of the westernized world."
p1330
aS'The reason I\'m a feminist isn\'t because of things so trivial as "oh but \nguys always hold doors open and are expected to be chivalrous." No, I\'m a \nfeminist because I want equal pay, I want to have the choice to do whatever \nI want with my own body, I want to expose and end rape culture (Google it, \nit\'s really interesting), I want to end slut shaming, and I want to end \nover-sexualization/objectification of women in the media. THAT is why I\'m a \nfeminist. (I love you though Ryan!)'

aS'Again, the things you are saying is what feminism should be, but look \naround, what have feminist done to try and change the equality problems \nrelated to men? Alot of Feminist say "fix your own problems" but then goes \non to oppose the legislation we try to change. I know there are good \nfeminist out there, but they aren\'t the ones in power, the ones changing \nthings, but I do see your point.'

I choose Black ops, hand me the god damn \ncontroller right now."
p1384
aS"However you deny it, it has been in the basic blueprints of our society \nwhich still remains now, whether it shows up more or less in some cases. \nAnd its all becaue women's bodies are considered sexual objects by the \nmajority. Because of this simple statement that we all unconsciously grew \nup with, the men still remain dominant. You can try to change it if you \nwant, at the risk of some people in public calling you crazy, but it would \ntake at least another century for any effects to happen."

aS'girl gets punched by a boy. boy gets punched by a girl. is their body \ndamage the same?'
p1390
aS'Also, just because 2 people are both feminists doesn\'t mean that they \nbelieve in exactly 1 thing. 1 feminist could be pro this and that while the \nother\'s not. He/she could also be neutral. One thing\'s for sure, all \nfeminists want women to have the same rights as men have. The word \n"feminism" only exists because gender inequality exists...by gender I meant \nmale, female, gay, trans or whatnot. If EQUALITY already exists, then the \nword "feminism" wouldn\'t even be needed in the first place.'
p1391

Sometimes girls taking the first step doesn't always work \neither and from the sound of these comments it sounds like some of u want \ngirls to act more like guys lol everyone is different don't categorize \nwomen into not giving back enough and not buying presents."
p1393
aS'This video has earned you a subscription. Thank you for this.'
p1394
aS'I know girls are not weaker. That is definitely a fact. They were just \nthought to be weaker in the old days, so people were more polite to them in \ngeneral then they were to men. But nowadays we can celebrate the fact that \ngirls are just as strong as men, and sometimes even stronger! :3'

aS'1:22 LOL NEVER NOTICES HE IS CHARGING HIS CONTROLLER BUT IT HAS NO BATTERY \nIN IT XD I Bet im the first one that noticed that'
p1396
aS'Men aren\'t always the ones facing rejection. Girls ask guys out too. It\'s \njust that, men tend to be more arrogant and make the first move. \nStereotypes play a pretty big part too. And as for the part about "body \nparts", well, men are always working out, maybe to keep healthy, but also \npartly because they want to show off their muscles. They believe it is more \nattractive to girls, and they have a lesser chance of rejection.(back to \nthe who makes the first move part)'

p1399
aS"Yes, I honestly think that men and women aren't the same. Men have the \nability to do harsh work for long periods of time. Girls can squeeze in \ntiny spaces but men can't(in general).

It's just a mistake if a woman goes \ninto the men's bathroom. Men are perverted if they go into the women's \nbathroom. If a woman's doing work, she asks for help, and gets it. If a \nman's doing work and asks for help he is lazy. If a woman splits the bill, \nshe's independent. If a man does, he's cheap."

p1466
aS'It\'s always been tradition for a man to open the door for a woman, pay for \nthe meals, and do kind things for them because in the old days, women had \nno rights,so men thought it would be a good thing to at least do some kind \nthings for them to make them not feel bad for having no rights. Even though \nwomen now have rights, the politeness that men should have for them hasn\'t \nchanged. It\'s also because girls are considered "weaker" that men should be \nmore polite to them then they are to other males.'
p1467
aS"You obviously haven't taken any anatomy class before, or at least haven't \npassed one. A man's chest consist of muscle and fatty tissue, so does a \nwoman's chest. Both men and women produce milk and can lactate it out their \nnipples. Of course Women produce more, and are prone to breast feed over \nmen, but in the end, the biggest difference between a man's chest and a \nwoman's is that a woman's chest tend to consist of more fatty tissue, while \na man's consist of more muscle."
p1468
aS'You are hilarious! I only just found your channel and am a number of videos \nthrough already :)'
p1469
aS"That's why men want equal rights as well. I hate being a guy."
p1470
aS"Screw feminism! Let's all be equalists! Both genders have their pros and \ncons.. We should just accept them, stop complaining, and be happy with the \nway things are cause at least we're not living in the 18th century."
p1471
aS"The frick. Where'd you get all this from?"
p1472
aS"not having milk glands has nothing to do with this. you can't see them"
p1473
aS'Omg I know so many people who are like that... Jeez.. Lol nice video! ;)'
p1474
aS"@Alicemary897 Yeah, but what Ryan is saying is if it's customary for a guy \nto do that stuff for a girl, then girls should do that stuff for guys too."
p1475
aS'And further you say "women want to be accepted as women". This is totally \nunacceptable. You are being accepted as a woman, and it has pros and cons. \nYou cannot wish away one of the other, because then you would be privileged \nover the other gender, who was pros and cons too!'
p1476
aS"there are so many men AND WOMEN that have downgraded themselves based on \ntheir actions and i do not like it. I dont like seeing women not being \npowered to do what they do best or BETTER but instead exposing their \nbodies. Same thing with men aswell. like i said its based on how they were \nraised, or the communities they grew up in. I am not a feminist.. I believe \nthat women and men's rolls should stay the same.. my personal opinion. \ndisagree if you want, its my opinion. Have a nice day everyone:)"

aS'Am I gamer girl'
p1481
aS"So you are a feminist, is that right? Well, if you are so sure about your \npoint, then I want to talk to you about the difference between wanting \nequality and wanting privileges. You want the same ammount of money for the \nsame work, I vouch for that. But it's impossible to achieve. Bosses pay \ntheir salari and if you want to divide gender, well one of the two HAS to \nbe less then the other because you cannot make the intire world pay the \nexact same ammount. That's fictional."
p1482
aS'-3=less than three lol'
p1483
aS"Quite true. As long as you know what Feminism and respect the movement, I \nknow where you're coming from even as a female. Good point. "
p1484
aS'I once asked a guy out and he found it embarrassing for him. I once said "I \npay" and he felt so umcomfortable that the girl pays, it was just awkward \nafterwards. I held up the door for a guy and he found it kinda \n"inappropiate" for the girl to hold up the door. I wanted to play \nvideogames and he said "I don\'t think you will like it" No, these weren\'t \nall different guys and it weren\'t all dates,so don\'t come with "omg you \nsuch a hoe" still a great video!

p1489
aS"lol in the vid, it isnt even toking abt showing private parts, it was jus \nsaying abt how girls can ask guys to show their bodies and nth is wrong abt \nit but wen guys ask girls to show their bodies, they get mad and it's the \nguy's fault and he is deemed as a perv. lol if boobs are private parts and \ncant be shown, fine, so guys showing chests/abs are fine cos they arent \nprivate parts? so if boys ask girls to show their legs, girls will lift \ntheir skirt up?"

p1494
aS'I asked out loads of boys'
p1495
aS'i respect your honesty!'
p1496
aS"You're right, except for the part about boobs. Girls have extra parts, its \nnot their fault. If boys had boobs too, I'm sure it would be the same. xD"
p1497
aS"I also find it hypocritical when other women go on and on about equality \nand yet still adhere to the codes for men: men should pay, ask her out, \nopen doors, wait on her hand and foot, etc. People should just be polite \nand do nice things to each other sex aside. I doubt this will be achieved \nany time soon, though. Until women reach a more equal standing and are no \nlonger seen as a minority, we won't be too harshly called out on the double \nstandards except by justly angry men. "
p1498
aS'Yeah. It\'s actually "more than three". Sorry algebra is taking over. lol.'
p1499
aS"I'm feminist, but only angainst men who deserve it. I admit there are girls \nwho exagerate, and so do men...equality, world. Equality..."
p1500
aS'some arent but i know what u mean'
p1501
aS"well I'm gonna ask one question. What is worse, if a girl tells you oh I \nlike your muscles or if a guy tells you wow you have nice boobs?"
p1502

p1503
aS"True that Ryan! And I'll be ur girlfriend!!!! Call me ;)"
p1504
aS"no offence, but that's probably not why you're single..."
p1505
aS'lol if people are arguing about feminism and shit just kindly shut up and \nenjoy the vid its not offensive in anyway its just the truth in a funny form'

aS"That xbox controller doesn't have any batteries! "
p1509
aS'so would u show ur boobs then, considering there not private pats....'
p1510
aS'I literally spent 20 mins looking at the arguments in the comments XD'
p1511
aS'I wouldn\'t call "boobs" extra parts. Women have breast, and guys have a \nchest(I know the breast area is also called a chest, but theirs two parts \nto your breast, and two parts to our chest). To add to that, and I know it \nmay be hard to believe, but a mans chest serves the same functions as \nbreast. Yes, we can lactate.'
p1512
aS"I think showing half of your tits to anyone you run across by wearing a \nshirt that barely covers your bra is just as bad, if not worse. Even if you \ndon't do it, a lot of girls do. And you're obviously the average, \noverly-sensative type of girl that he's talking in this video, it's clear \nthrough your comment. That's the only reason you're offended -___-"
p1513
aS"I didn't even punch him that hard. It was more of like a playful punch, but \na but harder. I'm not here to brag or anything, sorry if I did, but I'm \nonly saying that not all boys are violent, and not all girls are weak."
p1514
aS"I understand what you are trying to say, yes, but it's flawed. In technical \nterms, men do have breast, as I showed earlier how our serves the same \nfunctions as a woman's. Even back in older days, they usually only use the \nterm breast for both women and men. "
p1515
aS"obviously a feminist...thats not logic at all i'm afraid..."
p1516
aS'oh so ur calling me stupid..... yes lol'
p1517
aS"Dude, c'mon you understand what I'm saying. Men have nipples, not breasts. \nIf women's chest resembled men's chests, they would keep them covered. I \nagree with everything nigahiga said, though. I'm just saying. XD"
p1518
aS"But their not specific to a woman's gender. Breast is just fatty tissue, \nthat produce milk. A guy's chest has fatty tissue and produces milk. We \ndon't cover ours, because over time, it's become socially acceptable for \nmen to go shirtless, but not quite yet for women. So men don't feel the \nneed to always keep their chest covered."
p1519
aS"I'd date you. :)"
p1520
aS'lol!!!!! dear girl, take yo shirt off!!!!!!'
p1521
aS'show us your abs and im a guy'
p1522
aS'Lol, I love your videos <3'
p1523
aS"I find it funny that you assume I'm male (definitely female here). \nResponsibility does depend on risk, at least in jobs- if your job is \ncalling people and asking if they want double glazing, there's a lot less \nrisk/responsibility in that than, say, defusing bombs. Finally, do you \nbelieve in evolution? Then you'd realise that men evolved to hunt/defend, \nand women to raise children/gather. Males didn't decide to evolve in a \ncertain way, like we didn't. But it happened, so we made the best of it."

aS'..."need" a man just makes you look desperate. And guys don\'t like girls \nlike that. 3.) Not all guys sag their pants and that is the most sexist \ncomment on here that all guys sag their pants. The guys that have "swag" \nsag their pants and they are fucking morons. Those are the douchebag guys \nthat girls go for. And I have seen plenty of girls sag their pants or wear \ntheir v neck shirts. And its not because they are more "comfortable" \nbecause that is bullshit. You sit at the lunch table and push...'
p1538
aS'uhm, breast are not "private parts." Society says that boobs are but in \nreality all it is is fatty tissue. Guys have it too. :/'
p1539
aS'Oh right ^-^ '
p1540
aS"Ryan has ADHD - he cant concentrate on things; his mind tends to wander off \noccasionally. He explains that in his first Off the Pill video (it's a \nseries he started) that he has to take pills for him to concentrate or \nsomething. But in these videos, he's 'off the pill,' meaning he doesn't \ntake the pills. Therefore we see him blabber on about a bunch of random \nthings."
p1541
aS"So much hatred in the comments... I'm no feminist, or \nmasculinisterish...(O,O) or masochist, or sadist. or realist. I am a \nminimalist. but I dont think this is a minimal comment. Maybe Im a Hatist. \nI like hats. alot."

aS'V-Necks show AT LEAST 40%+ of their boobs, how much of a guys can you ever \nsee basically all the time 0% lol'
p1548
aS"I agree with Ryan on all of these. I'm a chick, and I HATE it when guys \nthink I wanted to be treated special. I've asked guys out before! I don't \nreally care if you like my boobs, blah blah blah, other stuff. Point is, I \nreally wouldn't care if a guy treated me like a guy, or if he wanted me to \nbring him a gift, etc... "

aS"I'll be your girlfriend! Don't be sad!"
p1551
aS'XD the ending "This video is not gonna help me get a girlfriend"'
p1552
aS"Just because girls wear their shirts with a V-Neck doesn't mean we want \ncomplements on our boobs, its just more comfortable than having a normal \nt-shirt sometimes. Some of us don't mean to show off our boobs all the \ntime, we just don't want to walk around uncomfortably (sometimes). Also, \ngirls can be very emotional, and we go through more in a relationship. \nMostly in marriages. That is my opinion about girls ^^ Don't hate -.-... "

p1559
aS"you clearly don't know how guys treat other guys lol"
p1560
aS"MOST guys wear shorts underneath, but not all do. Most girls wear bras \nunderneath their V-neck, unless the shirt provides it for them. And notice \nwhen I said that girls didn't sag their pants, I didn't say ALL. I never \ndenied that lots of girls wear V-necks, but instead I said that it was a \ngeneralization."
p1561
aS'2:23'

aS'You just made a generalization on women logic, so you have no right to \ntalk. By the way, did I ever say that ALL women sagged their pants? No, I \ndid not.'

p1565
aS'Some girls'
p1566
aS'Okay I\'m tired of these sexist comments. 1.) It\'s total bullshit that girls \ngo through more in a relationship than guys. Just because we don\'t show it, \ndoesn\'t mean we don\'t feel it. 2.) We don\'t look at girls as a sex toy. Yes \nall girls think we do but we don\'t. And girls can be just as bad as guys. \nThey say that all a guy wants is sex but then you hear them in school \nsaying "I miss sex" or "I need a man" okay just stop. You don\'t need a man \nyou want a man and because you are saying that you...'

p1571
aS"... It depends on a person. Ever get a girl mad at you? Sure, most boys are \nmore intimidating, but girls are SCARY when they're mad. I'm a girl and I \npunched a guy (cause he pissed me off) and he's held a grudge against me \never since. And I'm not even that violent. Girls are like cats, they wait, \nbiding their time, and when they either find a weakness or get pissed off, \nthey pounce. Most girls, anyhow. Most boys just go right into the fight."

p1575
aS'Yeah. That\'s the only think that came into my mind. And that\'s why I think \nthat homosexuals, lesbians and stuff, mostly just want to get attention and \nbe different. I mean it is said that they "feel" something to the other \nperson, but then well, what is it, if not biology, as you said.'

aS"housework and raising kids is nothing compared to dying on a battlefield or \nin a coal mine. or even spending 80 hours a week on the way to work and at \nwork. and as for girlfriends, how many of them getting royal treatment from \ntheir boyfriends are cooking and cleaning for their boyfriends on the \nregular, even 3 times a week? men's standards are apparently too low to \nsatisfy their needs, but these women mentioned sure are lazy and entitled \nlittle bitches."
p1578
aS'Yeah, but why do those "some" who do that, do it in the first place. Just \nwhat\'s the point? What\'s the reason/benefit?'
p1579
aS'Um, not always. With government jobs or government funded jobs, they are, \nbut within the private sector many women are paid less than men for the \nsame exact job.'
p1580
aS"Youre missing the point ....thats why we do customs for girls like hold the \ndoor open and be gentlemen .. girls deserve more sympathy and respect . But \nit pisses me off when girls try to want everything to be ''equal'' even \nthough everything in their eyes that are equal is unequal to us ... like \nequal pay is upholded .. but girls cant seem to want to take US out to \ndinner ?? ... bullshit .. guys are the underdogs girls are the queens . gtf \nover yourself ."

aS'Moral of the story, guys you need to get offended when girls compliment \nyour muscles.'
p1621
aS'That\'s one big problem in the humans mind: Remembering negative things \nabove everything else. Feminism itself isn\'t a vague term. It\'s just that \nsome people took it and just started to speak about it in different \ncontext, giving it another meaning.

aS'dear ryan how do u punch someone in the face?'
p1625
aS'Men are the vast majority in terms of rape, there\'s no denying that. But \neverything you\'re talking about is exactly what feminism is about! Male \nvictims not taken seriously because they\'re "supposed" to always want sex, \nmost rapists being men because society tells them to act on their power, \nwomen let off for crimes because they\'re "innocent" and "weak". This isn\'t \nabout blaming either sex, but recognising where this injustice comes from, \nbecause it\'s horrible for all genders.'
p1626
aS'True definition of feminist is support of a population that is treated \nlesser than normal. You could say supporting minorities is feminist.'

aS"Ryan doesn't back up the girls enough and he supports the guys. He even \nover-exaggerated. I like things to be as even as possible, so I countered \nhis argument. I'd like equality, but of course such a thing would be \nimpossible, but even so I'd like to help it along. Besides, even if the \nmale gender was being put down in such a way, I'd still defend it.

p1652
aS'I really doubt this video would stop you from getting a girlfriend o_o In \nfact, probably more so! Also, if I may get technical -soap box- all of this \nstuff is drilled into everyone due to society standards and how men and \nwomen are supposed to treat one another, blah blah. -off of soap box- But! \nBeing treated equal and like a "dude" is the best feeling in the world. \nAlso, HELLZ YEAH video games! Screw shopping =P'
p1653
aS'In my opinion, girls should behave like girls and boys should act like \nboys, but neither should be seen as less or more than the other. Equal, but \ndifferent!'

aS'Dear Ryan, Can you be a dog for a day'
p1655
aS'i just love the way you think !!!!!'

aS'HOW THE HELL DO YOU NOT HAVE A GIRL FRIEND! '
p1657
aS'I agree. '
p1658
aS"I've noticed that too. I'm a girl I've wondered how all of that even \nstarted. Well, I give my boyfriend a gift, I've asked some boys out myself, \nhold the door, I actually ply video games. But I've seen a bunch of girls \nacting differently. I guess I'm just the odd ball."

p1664
aS'I don\'t believe your "facts" sweety, women go over medical side, what is \nthis 20th century? what do you think, if people around you choose that \nprofession everybody\'s doing that? :D don\'t take numbers literally okey? I \ndon\'t mean some sovien union regime where there are 50male dishwasher and \n50 female dishwasher. I\'m saying women should have same amount of power as \nman have, and hold high class jobs, and own big businesses,You think that\'s \njust career choice and if you wanted it you could do it'
p1665
aS" We feminists don't focus only on one side. "
p1666
aS"The reason girls get offended about guys oggling their boobs is mostly \nbecause our breasts are private parts, so it's embarrassing to have them \npointed out. And there's more sexual attraction put into it than when girls \nlook at a guy's muscles."
p1667
aS"How come women are still paid less than men if they legally have the same \nrights? And it isn't just about rights. It's against sexism of any kind. \nMen and women should be treated equally in whatever situation."

p1673
aS'he has ADHD which is an Attention Disorder, they usually have to take \npills, he doesn\'t take his pills for a little bit and then makes "off the \npill" videos haha'
p1674
aS'The so called "war on women\'s health" goes further than just reproductive \nrights. Which to be honest, if there was a war on health in the \nreproductive department, it would be against men, since men have little \nreproductive rights as it is. This "war on women\'s health" involves cancer, \ndomestic violence(which seems to only point out males as the bad guys), \naccess to medicine, etc. You hear it all over the news, and news website, \nbut little about the health problems of men.'
p1675
aS"Female here who supports genuine equality, not female-domination like some \nfeminists do. Striving for female-domination of males is just as \nhypocritical as males dominating females. Both should have the same rights. \nSo males, don't bother opening doors or pulling out chairs for females (I \nknow we're generally physically weaker than you, but we're strong enough to \nmanage THAT), and females, stop hitting males and expect not to get hit \nback, and split your bills, don't leave it all to the guy. "
p1676
aS"I am a girl and I agree with Ryan. Women deserve equality when you can be \nidentical, like in the workplace (By that I mean in the end it doesn't \nmatter which sex did the job) but women and men are not identical, we were \ncreated to be puzzle pieces. Each one different with similar qualities."
p1677
aS"Some very valid points Mr. Higa lol. Like the door thing, I'm a girl and I \ndon't expect guys to open the door for me. I open the door for a lot of \nguys. That's just common courtesy. And like the boob thing, that just \ndepends on what the woman is wearing. Ladies, if you don't want guys to \nlook and make comments about your boobs, then PUT ON A SHIRT THAT COVERS \nTHEM. Simple as that. Everything he said does make sense, no one should \nreally get offended by this. Just saying"
p1678
aS'Oh believe me, I\'m not completly used to it. It\'s always like "Argh, that \ntime of the month again *grunts*" But I\'ve heard that birthcontroll pills \ncan make it stop. Both my mother and sister said that to me, so we\'re \nthinking about getting me some. You could try that'

p1688
aS'TAKE YO SHIRT OFF XD I laughed more at that than I should have...'
p1689
aS'amen thats all i got...'
p1690
aS'Dang, this video does makes sense! I like the part " Dear Girl, TAKE YOUR \nSHIRT OFF" part. Lol! Of course we are guys and girls expect us to make the \nfirst move on them, but we know that the probability chance that when \nasking a girl out is RISKY since we don\'t know if the girl will say Yes or \nNOO. The most thing a girl suffered from a guy is being dumped. But to the \nguys we have two things we fear the most which is rejection, being \ndumped... also being a father at young age. Lol but I like this'
p1691
aS'this is soooooooooooo true'
p1692
aS'not all guys are stupid....sooo.????? nd some girls can be stupid too, like \nu....1-0 Annie.!! 8))) hahaha '
p1693
aS"Well, I'm a girl :3 I can't stand attention. OKAY OKAY I KNOW I SOUND WEIRD \nWHEN I SAY THAT. But I think that a relationship with a bit more ... you \nknow, space, is a relationship that will last. Well, what I'm trying to say \nis that you don't have to be constantly attached to your \nboyfriend/girlfriend to be in a relationship. I have two friends who are \ndating and they're not always around eachother and have been dating for \nmore than 2 years. They're a very happy couple. "

p1703

aS'@spunkypunkchick i know what you mean with public boners xD'
p1706
aS"but I'll compliment your boobs if that's what you want...."
p1707
aS'your right my man'
p1708
aS'1:52 best part of video'
p1709
aS"ugh,why do I always have to explain this -.- look, feminism is about \nequality, as a feminist myself, I'm against the thought of guys having to \nmake the first move, paying for my meals, being tough, protective,or \nwhatever, the girls who do think that way are not for equality, they are \nfor women being in power, thus they are not feminists so, I really \nappreciate you making this video, because all girls should watch it, but \nplease don't label the girls who act like this feminists, cause they're not"
p1710
aS'Lol show your abs less than three!'
p1711
aS"Yea, he's right.... .-."
p1712
aS"Guys deal with boners in public, and father the child anyways. Listen both \ngenders have their things to deal with a sense of entitlement does not \nelicit equality. It's nice* to have them ask us on a date but they \nshouldn't have to. It shouldn't be a social pressure "
p1713
aS'now i can understand a little bit how boys think :) Thanks :D'
p1714
aS"Oh Ryan, You amuse me! i can't take you seriously mhan! (((o(*\xef\xbe\x9f\xe2\x96\xbd\xef\xbe\x9f*)o)))"

aS'i like your muscles...AH! hahahahaha'
p1716
aS"Hey Ryan I'll be your girlfriend"
p1717
aS"Yh but idk why when guys take the 1st steps it's normal but when girls do \nthey call them hoes?"
p1718
aS'SO TRUE!!!'
p1719
aS"I gave you real examples of woman not being in charge of big things, what \ndo you mean by social work and nursing. you sound naive,life choices? :D \nyou are hilarious, I won't insult your ass,we're talking real here. There \nis inequality against men, okey, by who? By other men you ..... I am not \ntalking about some crazy wife bitting his husband, or woman boss not giving \na raise to a man. that's rare first of all and on a big scale does not \nmatter"
p1720
aS'Yep. This. I knew other ladies had to be awesome like me. I put my favorite \ngame as my avatar. :3'
p1721
aS'In my opinion, there is inequality on both sides. Why dont we all work for \nuniversal equality? I understand the feminist point of veiw, and i am a \ngirl myself, but how can we be 100% equal with only one side being focused \non?'
p1722
aS'Those expectations are held onto from a time when women were viewed as the \nweaker sex. Idolising someone is just as dehumanising as debasing someone. \nFrankly things like a guy being expected to pay for a date is stupid, \nunless of course he earns more than the woman which is still likely. This \nof course can work both ways. Also, there are plenty of girl gamers who \nalso like shopping. '
p1723
aS"Ryan I'll be your girlfriend.."
p1724
aS"its ok, im like that too. you're like some anime/manga girls i read/watch \nabout. and thats perfectly okie!! girlie is weird, really really weird."
p1725
aS'go away.'
p1726
aS'See Adrienne Rich\'s essay on compulsory heterosexuality. The majority of \nmen think that paying for a woman\'s meal entitles them to sexual access to \nwomen so it\'s a bit more than a "free hug" Ryan...When a man tells a woman \nto take her shirt off or something similar the power dynamics are \ncompletely different than if a woman said something like that. She would be \nlaughed at and mocked. We live in a male supremacist society and men \nconstantly rape women and murder us globally. '
p1727
aS'ryan i LOVE it when you dress up like a girl..you actually look normal as a \ngirl!!'
p1728
aS"I sometimes wish I wasn't a girl in the first place :\\ It's just not the \nsame when I do some things."

aS'i completely agree with you '

aS"The only thing I don't like is that a woman I know has the exact same job \nas her friend-that's-a-boy and he gets paid over triple. :("
p1766
aS'in what world is getting rejected on dates and opening the door for \nsomebody as bad as the discrimination and oppression women have to deal \nwith their entire lives?'
p1767
aS'well said. cheers'
p1768
aS'Yeah this video is not going to help me get a girlfriend hhahaha'
p1769
aS"If they still haven't forgiven you, now might be a good time to apologize. \nEven if they said or did some pretty bad things themselves, it's never fair \nto hit a guy because we know that they can't hit back. That's cheap. Not \nsaying it wasn't justified in the moment, but I wouldn't do it and I feel \nbad for guys who get hit/slapped by girls and can't retaliate. I'm sort of \nsexist but against women, even though I'm a girl."
p1770
aS'Love Ryan Higa'
p1771

aS'thats what he said see what i did there '
p1778
aS'we dont have sleep overs because others judge it as gay'
p1779

p1780
aS'ok, right now?'
p1781

aS'Dear girls, TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF! ROLTF'
p1783
aS'dear ryan, what do guys do at sleepovers? '
p1784
aS'Haha, me too :D'
p1785
aS'Not all girls love shopping u know'
p1786
aS'This video is 100% right! I always thought about this too'
p1787
aS'a lot of the unfair things you pointed out (girls never asking guys out) \nhave to do with how guys being "unmanly" (a.k.a. like a girl) is considered \nbad, the underlying meaning being that femininity is "bad" as well. Think \nof the traditional homophobic insults given to guys: gay, pansy, -GIRL-! As \nfor girls, it\'s anything that\'s not demure, quiet, constantly agreeable \nrobots: bitch (speaks up), slut (purity glorification), cunt (female \ngenitalia OMG THE HORROR), etc.'
p1788
aS'Girls give gifts, too! That one in the video was SUPER stereotypical... And \nwhile I am a feminist, I agree that there are rights that men should have, \ntoo.'
p1789
aS'Dear Ryan, can you do a video where you scare random kids? '
p1790
aS'you talk so fast but i still understand it,Ryan'
p1791
aS'why do boys think all girls like shopping its so boring and usaly im \nplaying video games all day with my babyish dad...'
p1792
aS"I actually HATE to go shopping, with a passion! And if I didn't have any \nfriends to hang out with, I would hole myself in a room with video games \n24/7.....lol"
p1793
aS'Dear Ryan...can you do the salt and ice challenge?'
p1794
aS'i think that if girls want equal rights than they should be treated like a \nguy. me personally... i open doors for guys if i see them coming behind me \ncus i think its the right thing to do. id actually rather do that for them \nthan them for me. i dont think its okay for girls to hit on guys and them \nnot be able to hit back. if they want equal rights then there. but noooo. i \nam a girl and i believe you should respect your girl & do what you think is \nright but like ryan said...girls should do stuff2'
p1795
aS'I understand ...lol...the end'
p1796
aS'This is all that is true......... ALL of it'

aS'dude me too! lol i started playing COD awhile back wen barely any girls \nplayed it and now all of a sudden every girl plays. '

p1799
aS"I'm a girl but want to be equal :)"
p1800
aS'so true lol'
p1801

aS'Yeah! Gamer Girls Unite!'
p1805
aS'hey im a girl who ask guys out all the time '
p1806
aS"me too. i love having my bff Micheal over and we play video games or watch \nmovies. I'd rather have my boy friend and I both be happy than to have him \nbe miserable because of me. If girls want equal rights we should stop being \nso sensitive and man up. (it's okay to get dirty sometimes)"
p1807
aS'I like your muscles. :) Ahhhggg! D:'
p1808
aS'less than 3 lol'
p1809
aS"guys don't have sleepovers and when they do I'm guessing they think/talk \nabout what girls do at sleepovers. XD <3 (less than 3)"
p1810
aS'how about you fuck off'
p1811
aS'fuck shopping. I would of picked that controller up any day. '
p1812
aS"Ryan doesn't want KIDS! XD"
p1813
aS'I don\'t want to fight either, but I did want to make some corrections to \nyour comment. The fact that I said "radical feminist" was because I know \nall feminist isn\'t radical. The thing is, the face of feminism today \nbelongs to the radical feminist, meaning when I generalize, It due to the \nmajority of feminist being the feminist I mention. Even non-radical \nfeminist tend to not focus on men rights, and like I said if they do, \nthey\'d be attack and will no longer be a "real feminist."'
p1814

aS'No, actually, when it comes to stuff like "nice boobs" or "take yo shirt \noff", we don\'t get offended. We just don\'t wanna be sexually harassed. Now \nif someone calls a girl fat or stupid (even when they are the exact \nopposite), THEN we get offended.'

aS"I don't hate women. I hate some women. Just like I hate some men. Women who \nwield their femininity when it suits them, and then hide behind it and \nshout sexism and equality when they feel like it are the ones who often \nfrustrate me. WOMEN are the only ones who are allowed to define equality in \nthis conversation and that's the problem. It's selective equality which \nisn't equality at all."
p1863
aS'Amazing. You should tell Oprah. '
p1864
aS"I think the problem is that people don't understand what Feminism actually \nis. People have turned it into a completely different meaning. Feminism is \nabout gender equality which includes things that are 'expected' from guys \nlike buying all the gifts for their partners. The only people you should \nreally hate are the people who have fucked up the real meaning of feminism \nand turned it into something completely stupid and annoying."

aS"There have been studies where men and women both ran a company for an \nallotted amount of time. It was proven that the woman ran the company more \nsuccessfully than the man. But that's not all cases. Men and women should \nbe equal bread-winners seeing as both are equally intelligent. Masculinity \ndoesn't mean better than femininity, it's just a difference of gender."

p1954
aS'to bad everything he said was true, but you are just offended. How much \ndeeper does it go? Where were you educated? '
p1955
aS"First of all, I wasn't making fun of you. All I am saying is that we give \nwomen limits for gym class to give women a bell curve . But once in the \nreal world, do you expect employers to pay women the same for less \nproductions. It seems like you want women to get the same for less because \nwomen are expected in society to do less. Thus the idea of equality is an \nillusion. Although, I do believe women are allowed to vote, have property, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of action, freedom of belief.. etc."

aS"Countertenor1girl, have you seem Salt? Charlie's Angel? La Vie En Rose?"

aS"On the woman's side: Once you get hit in the uterus, it's never going to be \nthe same again, so that is very bad. It could cause you to bleed more \nduring your womanly time, prevent you from having babies, etc. Also, if you \nget hit in the boobs, it hurts, yes, but that really depends on how big the \nknockers are if you want exact amount of pain. On the man's side: Getting \nkicked in the balls hurts like Hell, I imagine. ALL OF THEM HURT IN ALMOST \nEQUAL MEASURES PEOPLE!"
p1958
aS"Maybe it's like how some things- inane things, like a certain genre of book \nor song- cause the release of endorphins in the brain. A person could \ninspire similar chemical reactions, like a particularly close friend. It's \nproven that homosexuality exists in non-humans, also, so it's probably not \njust attention seeking."

S'Americans go to hospital for nothing... jesus that was only a flesh wound. \nPut on something that absorbs it + tape. GG. Cut my lip in the bathtub and \nI bled like a mofo. Put pressure on it and some compress then tape, ready \nto go.\nIn Sweden we go for shit like: We did a backflip into a painting which \nglass broke and you landed in the glass and it cut your back open.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p10
aS'i was the first comment but i forgot to say so yayyy\xef\xbb\xbf'
p11
aS'Once when my brother was little, he had to go to the emergency room. It was \nlate, and there were a lot of people waiting, so he got tired and fell \nasleep. The nurses thought he had fallen unconscious so they panicked and \nrushed to help him. XD\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS"he's REALLY bleeding??? or wut\xef\xbb\xbf"
p13
aS"A small cut and your going to the hospital?\n\nI got hit with a gulf stick in my bottom lip half of it was hanging I was \npouring blood I didn't go too the hospital I couldn't eat or really talk it \nwas sliced opened and swollen. \n\nNot trying to hate but only pussy's go too hospitals for small shit like \nthat. #AMERICAFULLOFPUSSY'S\xef\xbb\xbf"
p14
aS'For everyone who\'s saying "Such a little wound and he\'s going to the \nhospital?"\n1. This was a real sword and I guess these people who say this don\'t know \nthe difference between a blade of a razor and the one of a ninja sword, but \nbelieve me, there are. And I guess you couldn\'t feel the pian through this \nvideo, could you?\n2. If you look at 4:19 you can see that the wound is a little deeper and \nwider so propably not as harmless as you think, which is proofed by the \namount of blood that came out of the wound in a really short time (2:33).\n3. His brother studied medicine and he\'s the one who puts on the green \nbandage. He will know if he should or should not go.\nAnd if you still ignoring all the facts, I just want to say:\nIf you get hit by a sword one day, you don\'t need to go to a hospital. No \none will judge. :)\nBut this time it was Ryan\'s decision and if he wanted to go, he will. And I \nthink it was good that he went, because you can see a red scar on his nose \nin videos months later.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p15
aS'thats not fruit punch...\xef\xbb\xbf'

True story. I feel better now though.\xef\xbb\xbf'

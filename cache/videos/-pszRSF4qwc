Not that it matters, but yeah, no rage \nthere... and that Violet person, really? you expect me to pass bashing her \nspelling? I rarely meet people like that on the internet and it's fun to \nwatch them justifying typing like that. And cLoVe's comment didn't relate \nto the video, just saying her mother commented on it."
p1612
aS'i tried this and got winded its sad '

aS'Ehtuhcka... ummn Etc. LMAO'
p1626
aS'cool story broh'
p1627
aS"Let's take a look here... Firstly, someone makes an innocent comment which \ndidn't affect you at all. Secondly, you come in and decides to be rude to \nthat person for no real reason whatsoever. Next, someone takes note of your \nobvious bitchiness. Then, you take the previous person's obvious joke too \nseriously, exhibiting said bitchiness. I also take note of your bitchiness, \nthen you take that joke too seriously. Now choose wisely. A.) You are on a \nman period. Odd. B.) You're just an asshole."

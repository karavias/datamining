p37
aS'I got bullied too, primary, all 6 years constant getting beaten, highschool \ntill 4th year pretty much the same without beating... then i decided to \ngrow some balls, work out and now noone talks shit. If you (reader) are \ngetting bullied, then straight up punch your bullies in the face. Even if \nthey outnumber you the simple act of defending yourself will make them \nhesitate of attacking. Maybe that moment they\'ll punch you but afterwards \nthey\'ll think.. "hmm do i want to get a right hook again?"... and keep \ntraining your boxing skills, get a boxing bag and try to punch harder each \ntime. Then when the bullies come, think \'boxingbag\'.. before you know it \nthey\'ll be sorry for every punching you. ;) good luck guys\xef\xbb\xbf'
p38
aS"this is really inspiration. when I'm having and bad day or just need to \nsmile your there for me. You make me smile an laugh. ur an amazing person \nand make me feel better bout my self. like i can do anything. that i am who \ni am and no one else can tell me other wise. Thx for always being there for \nme. :) ;D\xef\xbb\xbf"
p39
aS'everyone who makes this draw my life stuff says they got bullied in \nchildhood, i got bullied too, makes me think if being bullied is as normal \nas having a crush, but doing something against bullies is pretty easy, just \nlike you said but there are a lot of ways to deal with them, i grew up in \nperu and when i came to germany i had to deal with all those white high \nnosed bitches by being racist myself, hating everyone who was white and \nonly hanging out with other "dark" people, so becoming a bully yourself \nearns you a lot more respect but its somewhat pathetic if you look back \nnow... not all whites were that racist haha\xef\xbb\xbf'
p40
aS'Somewhat similar things are happening to me right now, im going through a \ntough time due to me transfering to a middle school in texas. I have barley \nany friends and its WAAAY different than TN. And it feels like the days are \nlonger here lol.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p41
aS"Hi I'm also starting a YouTube channel after most if what you have been \nthrough happening with me , I want to let my emotions out in a way and I \nthink YouTube allows me to do that , I've always loved video games and that \nis what I'm going to start now with a channel named AceKiller, if anyone \ncould subscribe it would help me out as It has been a dream for me to do \nthis\xef\xbb\xbf"

So my advice is to keep fighting it my bullying went away because I \ntold them to stop I told them to put themselves in my shoes and I also had \nfriends who would stand by me through everything! I am here for all of you \nguys no matter what because even tho I may not know you I still care for \nyou\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f stay strong and hang in there you can do it I believe in you! \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"This is great.\nI can relate to this so much.\nI'm currently in high school and as you said I look forward to class more \nthan I look forward to lunch just so that I don't look like a complete \nloser being alone. It doesn't bother me being alone but the fact that \neveryone sees me as the short weird girl with blue hair.\nLast year I decided to join the wrestling team which everyone is so wowed \nby since I'm one of the smallest girls in the school and being on a team \nwith all guys surprises people.\nWell I know this wasn't asked for but its nice to know more people go \nthrough the same I'm currently going through.\nThank you for all your videos, you're great ^.^\xef\xbb\xbf"

I've been bullied too and I've told my story \na day ago in one of the comments. I've learnt a LOT of things because of my \nexperiences and I'm very thankful for them because I wouldn't be this \nmature and have a good perspective of life and and a good take on things if \nI didn't go through all of those! Thanks for this video Nigahiga! This is \none of those videos which provide me with so much inspiration to chase my \ndreams and end the restricting life that I have right now!\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nThey tried to bully me in grade school for being fat. For a while it \nworked. I was sad and angry, but I couldn't fight back because there were \nso many of them. I basically took it out at home, being a bad kid there \nbecause there was nowhere else I could vent my sadness. But my mom wasn't \nhaving any of that. She basically chewed my ass out, screaming at me to \nstop being a little bitch and calling me a pussy for being so brave at home \nwhen I couldn't even fight at school. She chewed me out in front of my \nsiblings, then proceeded to elaborate on how there's no wonder I got \nbullied and that I deserve it for being a little shit. That pissed me off \nso badly. I'd never been so humiliated and angry, and I felt so betrayed by \nsomeone who I thought loved me. My mother says she doesn't remember it now \n(typical), but I do. The next day I got called to the principal's office \nfor fighting and injuring eight other kids. I myself had a black eye and \nmany bruises. My mom acted like a horrified mother while we were there. We \nleft the school for the day, picked up my siblings, and when we all got \nhome, my mom tanned my ass and chewed me out, telling me specifically that \nI was a little bitch that would never amount to anything, again right in \nfront of my siblings. It was horrible, but I endured it. From that day on, \nI've never let anyone succeed in bullying me (swift and brutally permanent \nretaliation keeps them from trying anything further), and life's improved \nall across the board. To be fair, my mom's a saint (stereotypical nice old \nwoman) most of the time, but she was the fucking devil with the tough love \nwhen she needed to be. I myself feel no resentment towards her anymore (I \nhated her all through out my teen years after the incident), and am \ngenuinely glad she did what she had to do back then. I almost never get \nangry now, and on the one or two times every couple of years that I do, \nit's intense and bright, but ultimately short lived.\n\nI'm happy and generally well-adjusted, I've got a wife, a kid, a good \nrelationship with my parents, and great financials. I don't let anyone walk \nall over me, and I don't set out to walk all over anyone. I genuinely feel \ngood about myself and life in general.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I can definitely relate to the "siblings out shining you" part. My sister \nis always getting good grades, and I\'m just failing. All I hear from my mom \nis: "Do better! You need higher grades! You\'ll fail in life!" But for my \nsister, it\'s always: "Great job! Keep it up! I\'m proud of you!" I don\'t \nknow why I\'m failing, I get the concepts. Sorry if it\'s too long.

The fact that when you got bullied (i was bullied \nterribly too by everyone in school) was because people liked to laugh, so \nyou made everyone laugh instead to take the spotlight from the bully. The \nfact you went to college and hated it, the fact you got rejected by the one \nyou loved in primary school. The only thing that was different literally \nwas you had an older brother and you did Judo and Wrestling. It might be \nthe common life for a nerd, but you have somewhat inspired me. :P \n\nSorry about the lame comment everyone haha, I had just to say it \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Fantastic video. (If you wish to skip my tangent, my summary is the last \nparagraph).\n\n1st I\'d like to say shame on many of these commenters for responding with \nsuch stupid, irrelevant, or trollful (har har har you\'re so funny, grow a \npair and lets see you do this) comments. \n\n2nd. Awesome video. It takes a lot to be able to do something like this \nESPECIALLY to millions of people (yeah you might never see them, meet them, \nor even speak with them but it still takes a lot, I know I wouldn\'t have \nthe balls to do something like this...then again I haven\'t gotten as far as \nyou have in life so maybe I could later...)\n\nAnywaaayyy I really admire your video. I can relate to many similar \nobstacles, not to the specific details like bullying or younger brothers \nseeming to be better (I say that because I\'m sure neither of you are better \nor worse then each other), but I can relate. Unfortunately I\'m not as \ngifted or simply haven\'t found a solution or a beginning to a path in some \ndirection yet, but I feel this video is an encouragement for many other \npeople.\n\nMy problem is (I don\'t want to vent about myself but there may be others \nwith similar thinking so hopefully I can speak for them also) that I have \nsimilar issues but I have not had any life changing experiences and I have \nnot found a passion. I feel a possible solution is if I just found a \npassion but unfortunately I have not found one. I feel exactly the same \nabout not having friends or a "group" and waiting for class to avoid \neverything, only I didn\'t join wrestling (or anything else).\n\nSo perhaps the solution to my (and hopefully others) problems is to just \nget out and do things and perhaps I/we will find my/our way. The question \nfor some of us is..how do we do that if we don\'t think we have what it \ntakes? It\'s hard to change your perspective when you\'re thinking is \nnegative and your perspective is "it\'s hard to change your perspective".\n\nI have not seen any of your other videos, other than your "How To Know If \nYou Have ADHD" video which brought me here, so I\'m not sure what your \nchannel/videos are about and if they are any good but I can definitely say \nyou seem to be  a positive icon, especially in the eyes of the youth. This \nvideo will probably encourage and/or help many who struggle today. It\'s \nhard to relate to a 60 yr old politician or a 40 yr old parent who thinks \nthey can fix you and try to relate to you but in reality they can\'t. Now a \nYouTuber with similarities and who live in the modern world (like us youth) \nis much different and although you might not be trying to cure cancer or \nsolve world hunger, you definitely seem to be a positive role model.\n\nSo to summarize this tangent; great video, from you\'re drawings it seems \nlike you\'ve overcome many obstacles and you truly seem like a good person \nand the world needs more of you. The youth need positive \nexamples/motivators that aren\'t dead people, old people, or people who have \nno similarities whatsoever. It\'s a shame adults+ just can\'t grasp that (or \nperhaps I\'m just a petty youth who doesn\'t understand something yet).\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"I have to disagree on the point where you can choose to be happy-- for \npeople who are profoundly depressed, that isn't really possible. \n Depression attacks a person mentally and even physically.  Depression \ntotally saps your energy (I was taking PE classes at the time so I got \nregular exercise, I was physically fit, that should have contributed to \nhaving more energy but it didn't).  One week I pulled up my bootstraps and \ntook it upon myself to try and be happy.  I smiled, acted like a happy \nperson, and tried to only think positive thoughts.  I have to admit, it did \nkind of work.  But depression is just like any disease.  I ended up \nexpending a lot of energy trying to be happy so it wasn't worth it.\xef\xbb\xbf"

It's some of our \nturn to be the next big thing. Believe in yourself, believe that your \nspecial and try figuring out what makes you different from others. Let's go \nout and change what other think about you. Prove everyone your something \nthat they can't be. Peace!! \xef\xbb\xbf"

I think their education \nsystem is really America-centric, and you know a lot of Americans never \nleave America. They don't really learn a lot about the world, so when they \ndo travel or leave America they tend to not really know things that a lot \nof the global community tends to take for granted, so they come across as \narrogant dumbarses. I think anyway. It's unfair but true."

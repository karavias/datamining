If someone \nwould have the heart just to give this a thumbs up and spend all of 30 \nseconds watching a vid, it would mean the world. Thank you all"

p960
aS'I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.....'
p961
aS'you dont have to know i was doing it to you..you said it yourself "your \ngullible if you reply back" and you actually replied to my comment \nfirst.....(the only reason your replying to me is cause i said ryan is ugly \nwhich i wrote first) '

aS'U talk really fast!'

aS"I could care less about winning. It doesn't matter to me, I just love \nfucking with kids like you. Obviously my comments have a point, or else I \nwouldn't be commenting. I AM far from losing, dumbass. You're sorry I'm \nstill while I can see hundreds of comments made by you. I don't even care \nabout your comment, but yet you're so ignorant and think that whatever you \nsay is important when it doesn't mean jack shit. "
p965
aS"Well, you shouldn't tell me that, I was like the last 3 comments. The rest \nwere some other people, but I agree."
p966
aS'LOL 0:10 XD'
p967
aS"When you were doing it to me i was doing it back to you...to make you look \nstupid because right now i'm doing it so when you reply back your gonna be \nthe one who looks stupid as hell...now you see my point??? i'm defending my \nopinion so i'm replying back...your replying back cause your defending your \nopinion..retard...i dnt giv a fuck 4 speling...( i spelled that whole \nsentence wrong on purpose)"
p968
aS'lol PubertyBOP'
p969
aS"I meant your comment about Ryan. I wouldn't give two shits, but you make it \nseem that you want people to value your opinion, when it's horse shit. \nYou're really dumb. I don't care about winning at all. If I obviously \ncared, I would have left already. And you're trying to tell me what you \nmean? Hmm, that's REALLY hard to believe, but honestly, tell me. Just go \nahead and tell me, because I'm pretty sure you haven't said it ONCE. And \nagain, I don't get it because whatever you say make no sense."
p970
aS"I'm not mad I'm pissed off cause retards like you have to fuckin butt into \neveryone else's opinions.

p973
aS'i called you a hypocrite cause you were saying that "since i\'m replying \nback to you i\'m gullible" but when i did reply back you replyed back to me \nwhich makes you gullible too..thats why your a hypocrite.. i purposely \nspelled wrong cause i wanted to tell you i dont give a shit about my \nspelling when i\'m on youtube. The only reason i reply back is cause i know \nyour gonna do it to so while you make me "gullible" i\'m amking you \n"gullible" too.'
p974
aS"Ok, so why did you call me a hypocrite? Plus, purposely spelling wrong \nmakes you look stupid, and you admiting that you were purposely spelling \nwrong, makes you look even more stupid. And also, how are you the one \nmaking me reply back, I was doing it to you. You replied to my first \ncomment, then I just continued so you would keep replying. Plus, you had no \npoint. You said I'm replying back, so I'm a hypocrite. That makes no \nfucking sense. Either you're stupid, or just trolling me."

aS"I said it first, and I stole it? Kid, you make no fucking sense. You're \njust pulling shit out of your ass just to comeback at me. Trust me, if I \nwanted my own comeback, I would have wiped it off of your mommy's chin. Try \ncoming up with something original, then talk to me. I don't wanna read a \ncopy/paste of what I said. You literally just summarized my comment. \nBesides, if you know it's the internet, then fuck off. We don't care about \nyou or your opinion. You haven't won by a long shot. Get lost."
p979
aS'bi'
p980
aS'And your point?'
p981
aS'i know its the fuckin internet...you just copied my line i said NO ONE \nCARES FOR YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!! Trust me your the same \nif you die no one will care another peice of shit gone from the earth. And \nyes it does make sense.'
p982
aS'LOL Do you expect people to mind their own business? This is the internet, \npeople can do whatever the fuck they want. How am I wrong when you\'re the \none defending a highly opinionated comment? Really, it\'s people like you \nwho deserve to rot. You\'re probably another internet bitch who thinks \neverything they do is important. Trust me, no one will care if you die \ntomorrow, it\'s just another piece of shit gone from the face oft he earth. \n"I\'m not mad, I\'m pissed off" ... yeah, that makes sense.'
p983
aS"I know you don't give a fuck about me, and I don't care. I'm not annoying, \nyou're just getting pissed off over nothing. I DO have a point in my \ncomments; they're to prove that you're not big shit. I'm far from losing, \nyou lost. I have a life, or I wouldn't be able to write this, obviously. I \nfeel sorry for you that you're still here. If you're really gonna defend \nyour worthless opinion til the day you die, you're probably better off dead."

aS'youll get the childrensbop pubertybop speechimpedimentstutterbop and not to \nmention bibimbap lol i love the way he sang lady gaga'

p1216
aS'I started it?!?!? ME?!?!? You\'re the one who fucking wrote " RYAN IS UGLY", \nso everybody wrote shit to you. Get off the fucking internet. As you can \nsee, NOBODY likes you. Sorry to burst your bubbles.'
p1217
aS"Okay thats cool ''hot shot'' You started this whole mess by saying AND I \nQUOTE ''ryan is ugly'' okay you can say ''ryan is the ugliest thing in the \nworld'' go ahead, and guess what your face is uglier. and if your face is \nuglier than ugliest, your face is sad. so very sad. You have the right to \nremain silent. Do that and the people of youtube will appreciate it. \nALLOTT!!"

p1223

aS'Dude, if no one has the right to comment on you, what make you think you \nhave the right to comment on Ryan? This is exactly what I meant when i said \n"god on the internet." If you think I\'m wrong, then you\'re on the wrong \npart of the internet.'
p1229
aS"finally you get it...and i know i probably shouldn't have posted that \ncomment but i didn't know so many people would attack me...i just dont get \nwhy this is a big deal...but thanks anyway"
p1230
aS'hes funny thats whyy'
p1231

I'm just \ntelling you that if you don;t share a comment like that on youtube, you \nwon't have to deal with other people that THINK you're hating on Ryan. So \nif would take my advice and stop sharing opinions like those yours it would \nlife alot easier for you and everyone else who thinks you;re a hater."
p1238
aS'ok '
p1239
aS"the only reason i'm replying is becasue i'm standing up for myself, my \nopinion about ryan didn't concern anyone else except ryan. And i know \npeople are just trying to tell me i'm wrong but there is nicer ways to say \nit "
p1240
aS'hahahha your a fagg'
p1241
aS'well than don\'t fight with me just post another comment saying "ryan is \ngood looking" don\'t correct me just make your comment if you disagree... or \neven make a comment saying "Anaa17867 is wrong about ryan looking ugly" why \nis everyone swearing at me to get a point through...or even if you have a \nproblem with it there are nicer ways to reply to someone...by the ways the \nonly reason i\'m not being very nice with replys is because other people are \nstarting it with hateful comments'
p1242
aS'retard...'
p1243
aS'i like tits '
p1244
aS'"I\'m sorry I won." - Anaa17867 What happened, Did I forget the reply button \nis optional? This is what happens when I leave the children loose. Oh and, \nyou should practice on how to type like a normal person.'
p1245
aS"ok??are you referring that to me cause it dosent make sense...no one thinks \nthat...yes maybe you have an advantage cause noone knows your name but \nstill ..my comment didnt affect anyone except ryan so no one has the right \nto yell at me cause i wasn't affending the viewer..."

aS'*What I meant *what* a hypocrite'
p1276
aS'people can just post that "ryan is really good looking" why do you have to \nfight with me?I dont care if you use perfect grammer...when i said mentally \nretarded i meant you need to understand what i am trying to say...cause you \nclearly dont'
p1277
aS"THIS ONE'S MY FAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
p1278
aS"Such an ignorant hypocrite. You're right, it's your opinion, but that \ndoesn't mean it matters. And if it did, then everyone else's opinions about \nyou matter, too. You're basically telling me that your opinion is the only \none that matters, and everyone else's doesn't. Why keep our opinions to \nourselves when you posted yours on Youtube? An even better question is, why \ndo you keep replying if you don't give a fuck? I'm CLEARLY not mental in \nanyway. Why else would I be using perfect grammar?"
p1279
aS"Next to your comment there's an arrow. Click on it and it will give you the \noption to delete your comment."
p1280
aS'i realized theres no point to doing that because all the people who reply \nto me about it have no life..so im gonna keep it there just to see how \npeoples lives have become so worthless'
p1281
aS"well than they dont have to be mean about my comment...they're not infoming \nme, they're saying that i'm retarded and i'm not gonna put up with it... \nthey COULD just write that it was mean and i shouldnt say that...by the \nways I could ask you the same question. Are you on your period? dumbasss"
p1282
aS'GUYS, GUYS! STOP ARGUING WITH THAT ANAA CHICK OR MAN OR WALRUS OR WHATEVER. \nRYAN MADE A RANT ON ASIAN DRAMAS FOREVER AGO. (is trying to watch all of \nthe videos) '
p1283
aS'Really? He can post whatever he wants, but we can\'t? His opinions matter, \nbut ours doesn\'t? She obviously respects you because you\'re as ignorant as \nher. Oh, you\'re sick of the argument? Then why get involved in it? It\'s \nYoutube, did your really expect people NOT to reply to her "obviously \nimportant" comment? She\'s basically doing the same shit. She told me she \nwants us to keep our opinions to ourselves, when she can\'t even keep her \nmouth shut. Really logical.'
p1284

p1285
aS'C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!!!!!'
p1286
aS'0:36 my favorite part.'
p1287
aS"Well, I'm just saying that you should think twice about sharing opinions \nlike those of yours, because most of the comments that I read that were in \nreply to your opinion didn't seem to like it. So technically you are \nbothering other people. If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't \nsay it."
p1288
aS"Of course I don't, because you make no fucking sense. You're arguing with a \nbunch of his fans, so obviously people won't agree with you. You should \nknow better. I'm not even fighting with you over that. I'm fighting with \nyou because you're too stubborn to realize that people don't like you and \nyour opinion, and you have to accept that, but NO! You have to bitch about \nhow your worthless opinion matters. Also, I'm using perfect grammar because \nI'm not an illiterate fuck in 3rd grade on Youtube."
p1289
aS'LOL @HIGA TV You like your own videos. (: lol '
p1290
aS"I KNOW PEOPLE DONT LIKE MY OPINION!!!I'm not retarded like you...all i'm \nsaying is that dont argue with me on my opinion just write your own..if you \nthink ryan is hot than comment that why do you have to fight with me????or \ngive me a thumbs down..i'm getting random replys in my email and i'm fuckin \ntired of it!!! i dont fuckin care if you use perfect grammer!!! its not \ncalled being a bitch its called standing up for yourself!!!"
p1291
aS"aahhhhhhhh.... okay, maybe if youngmeaning, jeffry monsalud, soupladleguy, \npikapro789, lashkeiser, royal doofus, king ronnie 500, and hea matt who \nstarted this thing in the first place just shut up and let anaa17867 post \nwhatever comments stupid or not she wants and the matter is resolved. if u \ndon't like a comment just thumbs down or somethin, don't need to start \nswearing or anything, i'm sick of this arguement!"
p1292
aS"ACTUALLY, the're realizing your mistake and informing you about it. I do \nhave a life and you're just being bitchy. Are you on your period?"
p1293
aS"@joesgirlfriend1 That's true. But now at least we both know we aren't the \nonly ones that feel that way."
p1294
aS'I wonder how long it took to get all of that right talking that fast'
p1295
aS'Show comment, Show comment, Show comment, Show comment, Show comment. \nComment does no longer exist. BASTARDS!!!'
p1296
aS'That\'s your problem. Why do you keep replying to everyone if you go with \nyour opinion, especially when half of the comments you get are hateful? \nIt\'s one against around 20. You\'re not gonna win. I don\'t even care about \nyour opinion, I just wanted to troll you, but then you had to be all \n"internet tough guy" on me and defend your pointless opinion. If you say \nsomething mean, people are gonna get angry. It\'s common sense, dumbass. \nYou\'re not a bitch for defending it, though. You\'re just stupid.'

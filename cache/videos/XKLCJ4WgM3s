But people like nigahiga because even when he hasnt \nmade another one in a while every video he makes is great and gets alot of \nviews. Some of you people are going overboard .Its youtube'

p748
aS"@whalesrock111 rwj doesn't seem to work that hard, although he is funny. \nhis videos consist of OTHER PEOPLE'S VIDEOS and him telling 2 or 3 jokes \nabout them. so, even though he might work to make the videos, he doesn't \nseem to work as hard as some others for the amount of subs/views he gets."
p749
aS"@whalesrock111 you're contradicting yourself. Anyways I like both but I \npersonally lie nigahiga better.

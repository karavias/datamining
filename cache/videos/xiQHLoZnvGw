I am completely alone, I have crippling social \nanxiety not to mention having Asperger Syndrome doesn't help. I'm also \nphysically ill with Graves' Disease so that sucks. Fuck life, I'd rather be \ndead.  I have no confidence, no self-esteem, no self-worth. I'm an ugly \nfuck who has no hobbies except playing video-games and browsing the \ninternet. Also, what I find ironic is that people say there's always \nsomeone out there for everyone, isn't it funny that they wouldn't be seen \ndead with the people they're targeting that towards.  \xef\xbb\xbf"

p54
aS'Teehee\xef\xbb\xbf'
p55
aS'Personally I think being forever alone is mainly a choice of self-defeat or \nacceptance. No offense to any of you guys out there who are actually \n"alone" but sometimes you just need to go out for it. Granted I\'m still \ndeciding, but there\'s nothing wrong with being "forever alone". It just \nmatters on how you look at it like almost everything else. You can look at \nit like it\'s a depressing thing that you won\'t achieve or at a challenge \nand think "I just have to keep looking". Or you can just accept that your \npresently alone and get on with life and stop feeling a pity-party for \nsomething you may or may not have. You go Ryan!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p56
aS"I only had one bf for 3 years and we broke up becos... yeah he was cheating \nand also had to move out of town but I never hate this guy who make me feel \nthe butterfly for 3years. And actually I don't really mind he left me since \nI was so clumsy shy girl we barely had time to had a normal relationship. \nBut now he's gone and the sad part is he was 25days closer to his wedding. \n\n\nAnd I still have no idea why I put this in the comment, awkward right? \xef\xbb\xbf"

As a person who wants to analyze every emotional feeling, love \nis one of the most difficult things to define. I know, I know, "it has a \ndifferent meaning for everyone" or "love is not something you can put into \nwords" but you don\'t understand, I have to know. I HAVE to.

You have all of your life to live \nand yet because you can\'t find a boyfriend/girlfriend in your high school \nyears, then you\'ll never find love. <-really not true. Also, people who do \nhave a boyfriend/girlfriend say things like "It\'s true love" or "We\'ll be \ntogether forever". sorry to bust your bubble but how can you say that when \nyou\'ve been together for...oh I don\'t know...a week?

aS"This morning I decided to make a new holiday for people who aren't in a \nrelationship called Semper Solus and the story of how it was created goes \nlike this:\n\nCupid had a brother, his brother was named f\xc3\xbcr immer einsam. He begged his \nbrother to let him fall in love, but Cupid said no. F\xc3\xbcr immer einsam was \nangry so he begged to the gods to make his brother get him someone. So they \nsent him chocolate in a golden wrapper. f\xc3\xbcr immer einsam gives Cupid the \nchocolate the smell was very strong and Cupid drooled a little on it, but \nthen drops it and it falls on Earth. A human picked it up and bit it, all \nof a sudden they felt very sad and lonely that they'll never find someone. \nThe human went home and flipped through a book and felt something magical \ntowards the character wishing the character was real. The human went crazy \nover any mention of the book or character and then brought the chocolate to \ntheir friends who also bit it. The same thing happened to them, and the \npattern continued for years and years, every time February 14th came around \nthey all felt lonely and wanted love, so they celebrated by using that \nmagical feeling towards the characters and called it fangirling. Whoever \nhad a taste of the chocolate would have at least one family member keep \nthese strange magical  feelings and will keep passing it on forever. \xef\xbb\xbf"

My dream is to become a filmmaker, and I just got 480 subscribers \nwhich is quite impressive to me, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never get noticed with these \nnumbers. EVANFRIESENFILMS does VFX, so if someone would have the heart to \nspend just a minute watching a video, and maybe SUBSCRIBE, or give this a \nthumbs up, it would mean the world. Thank you all.'

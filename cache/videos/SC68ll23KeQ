S'Its so true! Why is it that some guys think a girl shaking her booty is \nattractive? ! Its disgusting! The most attractive person you can meet is \nsomeone who has morals and stands up in what they believe in. I think you \nwere truly inspired to make this video Ryan! Love this!!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p10
aS'It was funny, but it made me uncomfortable. Too much slut shaming, \nespecially in the beginning. Though the end could arguably be spoofing \nslut-shaming itself (when he gets mad at her for trying to kiss him ON \nTHEIR WEDDING DAY lol). Anyway, slut shaming isn\'t positive. I don\'t want \nto be liked because I\'m "different from those slutty girls who show off \ntheir ass and what-not." Also, the lyrics make it seem like having a big \nass or big boobs is inherently slutty, even though that\'s just some \npeople\'s body type. So... funny attempt, but no "like" from me. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p11
aS'You can still be "stylish" while dressing modestly. Muslim women/girls are \ntold to wear hijab (head scarf) and wear long loose clothing that doesn\'t \nreveal the shape of their body or their skin ( except face and hands). \nHowever they can still be in with the fashion and do whatever they like. \nThey dress in this manner in order for people to look at the amount of \nknowledge they have, their intellect, manners, personality etc rather than \ntheir outer appearance... well that\'s only one reason.\n\nYet, the world thinks they\'re oppressed. LOL\xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS'Inspired by the wonderful music on the radio today!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS'I wish guys would actually act like this xD (well apart from the ending :P \n)\xef\xbb\xbf'

p16
aS'I thought that nice guys finish last though....\xef\xbb\xbf'
p17
aS"I can't believe that she tried to kiss him\n\n\n\nWhat a bitch \xef\xbb\xbf"
p18
aS'Kina is definitely an SWG! Awesome job RHPC!! So many capital letters!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p19
aS"WHAT? Suggesting that these covered up girls are more 'moral' and \n'wholesome' is straight up slut shaming.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p20
aS"That was adorable and funny, but why are girls with double D's not sweet \nand wholesome? I have double D's. Maybe they're just that big to make room \nfor my huge heart ^-^ obviously I get the satirical nature and enjoyed it\xef\xbb\xbf"
p21
aS"I have come to the conclusion that this is the polar opposite of the 'nice \nguys' song\xef\xbb\xbf"
p22
aS"*Ryan Higa & **+Josh Golden** - S.W.G.*\n\nCheck out this hilarious rap music video from +nigahiga and #GOLDEN  as \nthey take on the genre's stereotypes!\n\n#Music   #Funny  \xef\xbb\xbf"
p23

p31
aS"I'm a sweet wholesome gal :)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p32
aS'I think Josh might be gay. just saying.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p33
aS"This is kinda unfair justice to the rap genre, don't let mainstream music \ndefine the rap genre..some good example of rappers who write lyrics from \nthe heart are jcole, Nas, Kendrick..but atlast, ignorance is bliss...\xef\xbb\xbf"
p34
aS"Mega troll at the end there. Good. I mean, I want girls and boys to be a \nbit more thoughtful sexually for sure, but let's not shame people, \nespecially girls, for knowing things like what a clitoris is. Or for \nactually wanting to have, and enjoying, sex, as opposed to just doing it \nfor the guy like it's some chore only males and whores enjoy.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p35
aS'how do you make the horizontal lens flares like the ones in this video ?\xef\xbb\xbf'

p40
aS'I was hoping for a happy ending. HOW COULD DO THIS TO MEEE???\xef\xbb\xbf'
p41
aS"Reading the comments, people keep saying stuff like 'guys are disgusting \nwanting big bootys etc'. I think that can be very sexist tho. There are \nvideos of dudes humping the ground to music and dancing sexually. Many \nfemales love that stuff. Like I'm a female but I feel it's not fair to \nmales that they have a rep of being rude and gross etc when girls are \nliterally reacting the same way guys do. But guys get the hate ?? Sexist \xef\xbb\xbf"

p132
aS'1.25\xef\xbb\xbf'
p133
aS'to everyone that thinks this video is slut shaming, it is not. \n\nryan is commenting on the type of female typically idealized (or degraded, \ndepending on your point of view) in rap songs. (i say degraded because, uh, \nhave you seen eminem\'s lyrics about iggy azalea?)\n\ni think he is actually empowering females, saying that being a sweet, nice \ngirl is just as valid and just as desired as being a "bad" girl as \nportrayed by mainstream media. women should never feel pressured to be more \n"bad" to win societal acceptance and affection.\xef\xbb\xbf'

At times it insinuated these attributes, but there's \na little too much of the \xe2\x80\x98expectations of women in society' slant on it.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"good music video! however, it does seem to demonize women who wear \nrevealing clothes or have a lot of sex. It really is their choice what they \nwear and how much skin they show, everyone's different with their lever of \ncomfort in terms of clothing. same thing with sex. It isn't bad to have a \nlot of sex and it isn't bad to not have sex at all. The video could just be \nmaking fun of the social construct  of prude vs. slut, though. sometimes \nit's a bit hard to tell with Ryan Higa.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p533
aS'Guys be more positive! Sluts are girls or guys who sleep with a lot of \npeople without any thought. Ryan never stated anything about having sex \nwith random people. Your slut shaming yourself by saying your a slut by how \nyou dress and if you twerk. Has no one else realised that?\xef\xbb\xbf'

It's your body, your allowed \nto dress and appear as you like without people having to tell you that your \neither too much of either thing. Same goes for guys.

I don\'t care what people think but \nthe viral meme about "girl don\'t show me your boobs show me your heart" is \nnot gay at all. We need to challenge stereotypes. If wanting girls for \ntheir D cups only is cool and even girls falling for these assholes, then \nthis world is seriously fucked up. Girls need to respect themselves before \nhaving others respect them. And guys should stop effing objectifying women. \nAnd don\'t start the stupid argument about "guys are totally rapists, they \nhave problems" or "free the nipple shit" here.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'I know a lot of people are criticizing this video for "slut shaming". At \nthe begging I thought they were slut shaming too, honestly my first thought \nwas "Ryan is turning into a  \'nice guy\' ", but I decided to stick it out \nuntil the end. My final conclusion is that he\'s criticizing both the \nobjectification of women in rap and this "nice guy" counterculture that \nacts like girls should still be walking purity, the reason I thought this \nis because of the ending where he gets angry that she tries to kiss him. \nFeel free to disagree, that\'s just my opinion and the reason I found this \nvideo funny\xef\xbb\xbf'

p870
aS'I usually love all of your videos but I can\'t help feeling that this video \nis slut shaming girls who engage in sexual activities and wear clothes that \nreveal some skin. And that you only like this girl because she\'s \n"alternative" and different from every other girl. While rap videos are \nextremely provocative these days at the end of the day it\'s the artists \nchoice to express themselves however they chose and if that means wearing \nrevealing clothes and dancing provocatively then so be it, who are we to \njudge what is and what isn\'t entertainment. I think you missed a trick with \nthis video here as I was rather offended throughout. \xef\xbb\xbf'

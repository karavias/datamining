aS"This made so much more sense when I watched it while listening to You're \nBeautiful on my iPod. I was so confused the first time..."
p130
aS'The actual songs name is "bring me into life" or "wake me up inside"'
p131
aS"sometimes I think that the other guy in Ryan's videos is just an experiment \nmouse"
p132
aS'WHO MISSES SEAN?!!'
p133
aS"Pretty sure he used this song because of copyright reasons. .-. I used to \nhate when they'd force us to all switch to unfitting music. But nooow ;) \n-Trauma Tize"

p142
aS'Happy Birthday Ryan!'
p143
aS'After being on YouTube for a while now, I know how much hate people can \ngive when reading these kinds of comments, but I think Nigahiga fans might \nbe nicer. My dream is to become a filmmaker, and I just got 480 subscribers \nwhich is quite impressive to me, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never get noticed with these \nnumbers. EVANFRIESENFILMS does VFX, so if someone would have the heart to \nspend just a minute watching a video, and maybe SUBSCRIBE, or give this a \nthumbs up, it would mean the world. Thank you all.'
p144
aS'due to copyrighted material youtube removed this vid a couple years ago and \nryan uploaded using another song instead of the one in the description lol \n;p'

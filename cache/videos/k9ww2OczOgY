To most "Gamers", Gaming is just a hobby that we \nenjoy to do such as other people doing/watching sports or talking about \ncars. So basically i think you should be allowed to game if you enjoy it. \nsome People may say they hate gamers because of the media.

While I \nsuppose some people like the excitement of the journey, but I totally agree \nwith camping. Nothing gives me the pleasure of completing a task with as \nhigh efficiency as possible, and isn\'t that what camping is?

In artial marts too, it's just pure \ntrainning, not to mention you can train your eye and open your perimeter, \nand see who is alone to pass the ball and stuff...

p697
aS"I feel like a lot of that was geared to shooters, which is fine, write \nabout what you know. But there's a lot to be said about video game story \nlines. Like any other story through books or movies, video games can delve \ninto some deep concepts while giving you the intractability hopefully \nimmersing you deeper into the emotions and questions the story is trying to \nprompt.\n\nAnd i think striving to get better at anything gives you a taste for always \nimproving yourself. That can be anything from dancing to judo to calculus, \nbut it can also be competitive fighting games, competitive MOBAs like Dota \n2, rhythm games, or even just being good enough at a game to make it to the \nend regardless of how hard it is.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'correction: GOOD video games teach important life lesson...and are great \nfor parties. nothing says christmas like super mario 3d world with your \nfriends on a couch trying to get those green stars.\n\nin all seriousness though, games are an interactive medium and are \ngenerally far more engaging than TV or movies, allowing for better \ncognitive development in kids (provided that you have them play the right \nkind of games). furthermore, competitive gaming takes a lot of mental \nstamina to compete in because, like in real sports, losing is very \ndisheartening. learning to never give up is something i picked up from \nwatching evo tournaments. other games force you to use your head for some \nvery interesting puzzles (i.e. portal)\xef\xbb\xbf'

My friends who don't play video games \ndon't  do well in sports. and they don't think about how actions can affect \nthem in more ways than one!!! But I will admit while these people are \ngetting law degrees and im getting tec geek jobs. Nothing wrong with tech \ngeeks. Not only are video games fun they are informational. Like bad \nexample but, ABC mouse, for example. It is a game teaching letters numbers \nand reading skills using video games. Plus everything we do involves High \ntech things.

aS'I get the refreces but i also get that you play mostly high on list, \npopular, evryone has heard of them kind of games: FPS. Not that i look down \non you or anything, but you seem like quite the casual. But i myself on the \nother hand am a nolife who plays nonstop over a waration of consols. I like \nthat you are on the gamers side in this but you should maybe take acount \nfor all of games, not just FPS, Strategy, phone games (dont realy want to \ncount them as games) and the few kids games you played groing up. If you \nare targeting non gamers you should go a bit deeper than at the tip of the \niceberg. They always see the tip, i thik they need to be shown more of the \ncomunity. of course they cant go too far down whitout being ready, or else \nthey will be sceard away. \n\nThis is of course just my opinion, have an open mind an dont rush to a \nblame or hate. read and think for yourself. I dont want to start a flame \nwar about the casual vs non-casual theme. \xef\xbb\xbf'

Just 50% of cops are \nassholes not all of them. \n\n\nP.S. Never give them consent to search your vehicle or you. Also, you do \nnot have to answer any of their questions without an attorney present. \nAnother thing, remember the golden phrase: "Am I being detained, or am I \nfree to go?"

aS"People driving fast is actually not a dangerous act.  Speed limits and \ntraffic laws involving speed actually cause more accidents.\n\nMontana used to have no speed limit laws during the day time on the \nhighways.  Once they enacted laws fatalities and accidents both more than \ndoubled and since then.\n\nNot all laws make sense, and most laws are actually enacted as knee jerk \nreaction (response) to something going wrong.  Their is a public outcry \nfrom 10 - 20% of the population at most, and they dictate how the other 90 \n- 80% of society should live.  That's not democracy by the way, that's \ncalled a dictatorship. A minority should not dictate to a majority. \n Several laws only make life harder for those who already act sensibly and \nrespect other humans.  Whether a law exists or not a criminally inclined \nhuman will still break the law.  Laws do not make magical barriers.\xef\xbb\xbf"

I respect the police and what they stand for, however I \ndo not deny that some police officers forget that they are there to serve \nand protect. Some officers become overwhelmed with the power they believe \nthey have and feel the need and right to use it against those whom they are \nsuppose to protect. Some citizens also forget that not all police officers \nare power hungry and begin to stereotype all policemen and women. We tend \nto forget that police officers are humans to, we tend to forget that they \nhave families and something they want to protect. I believe that there is a \nlot to be done with the police but that there is also good in there too\xef\xbb\xbf'

The he asked respectfully said yes \nand the cop said  " because you\'re honest I\'m not gonna search your camp.  \nJust be out of here by the time we come back. "  The cops didn\'t come back \nand we were able to stay and have a good time all weekend.  However, in the \nnext camp over when they asked one guy if there was alcohol the guy said no \nand his camp was searched.  I don\'t know if the guy was telling the truth \nor not and I have my reasons for not liking cops but if you\'re respectful \nand you\'re honest then you\'ll be alright.\xef\xbb\xbf'

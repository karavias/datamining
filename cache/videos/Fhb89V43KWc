aS'All western science, philosophy, ancient and modern, from Greek atomism to \nquantum mechanics, Democritus and Aristotle to Bohr and Popper, have been \nand are fundamentally limited to a partial and distorted copy of reality in \nour brains. Thus, from a certain point-of-view, a house of cards built of \nshaky foundations. The scientific worldview is a result of an internal \nmodel of reality whose unreliability is an inescapable implication of that \nvery model; a self-referential epistemic contradiction.'

S'Tips on how to Survive a Horror movie\xef\xbb\xbf'
p10
aS'dont be black, they die first \xef\xbb\xbf'
p11
aS'am i the only person the runs to there bed or up stairs when i turn of \nlight or i run to the light i mean really am i or am i the only person who \nlike dives though a door and shit and always feels like there being \nwatched \xef\xbb\xbf'
p12
aS'to survive every horror movie just bring a can of that foam they use to \nblock doors and leaking pipes\xef\xbb\xbf'
p13
aS'When I was a kid I was scared of nothing but frickin bathroom sh1t. \nLiterally everytime the automated air vent turned on I would almost piss my \npants and run to hide under my blanket. It was literraly just bathroom sh1t \nthough. Whenever something would fall from my shelf or I herd something \nmove In somewhere other than the bathrom I would just think,"I hate wind"\xef\xbb\xbf'
p14
aS'all of the ppl who born at october is sad\nlike me D:\xef\xbb\xbf'
p15
aS'I could totally see you as Magnus Bane from TMI\xef\xbb\xbf'
p16
aS'What\'s that "ghost" thing called when he was brushing his teeth?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p17
aS'My school was from the 1900s and there were rumors that it used to be a \nprison. Once my brother found a very old key in the bathroom and he and his \nfriends tried it out on all the doors in the building, but it didn\'t fit \nany of them. There was also a small house in the front of the school and it \nwas like an abandoned warehouse and there was a lock there so everyone \nassumed that it was the key to there. But no one tested it, because that \nthing was daaaaamn creepy. Luckily, they tore the warehouse down, but after \nthat the lights started to turn off randomly during classes. Most teachers \nwere saying, "The new lights are terrible, they have motion sensors but \nthey barely work so that it sometimes thinks everything isn\'t moving so it \nturns off." But everyone thought that was bullshit. Plus, there were \nsometimes thumping noises in random classrooms.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p18
aS'I used to always say that as well, "Why are you going toward the sound!? \nIdiot!" But I realized something. In real life when I hear a strange sound, \nI investigate it. I always assume it\'s something reasonable and logical, \nlike my cats knocking something over, someone I live with doing something, \nor the like. If you aren\'t expecting there to be anything scary or unusual, \nthen it\'s pretty normal to investigate any strange sounds. \n\nSo in conclusion, it only seems stupid because you know it\'s a horror movie \nand something is bound to happen. But the person in the film isn\'t supposed \nto know that it\'s a horror film (that\'d be a meta reference!) and so it\'s \nreasonable for them to check things out. (Though, if they know somethings \nup and they check anyway....well...)\xef\xbb\xbf'

Get a pair of submachineguns \nand run around spraying everything that moves.\n\nSee a run down abandoned haunted house? ARRRRRRR PEEEEEEE GEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'You forgot to say to never accept or use anything old in a house that was \nleft behind by the previous owner. Examples would be: an old piano, a \nrecord player, an old telephone, paintings, statues, old boxes or chests, a \nfancy-looking drawer, suits of armor, a rusty, fancy-looking key or a \nlocked door, and anything old and/or antique because chances are that it \nmight be haunted\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"When you and one or more people are with you, use common fucking sense and \njust don't split! I mean, what's the point? By splitting it means you're \ntrying to find the murderer that's chasing you, not avoid him. There's \nabsolutely no reason to separate. I don't understand why they even add \nsomething so stupid in movies anymore. It's even dumber than investigating \nthe dark room that makes weird sounds.\n\nBy the way, there's someone behind you, don't turn around. Boo!\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Working night shift for 6 hours with animatronics at a creepy pizzaria with \n10 animatronics and a guy who you thought was dead but is still alive and \nyou heard children went missing. GTFO!!!!!!!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p56
aS"TIP: Smiling while watching horror movies prevents one from getting \nstartled during suspense scenes, since smiling sends positive endorphins to \nthe brain, making one inevitably happy... weird, huh? Now, I almost start \nto chuckle when scary-ass looking faces appear out of nowhere AND flinching \nis no longer an issue. It comes in handy to be genius at innovative \nthinking... yes actually genius. I hope my tip helps some of you. But, just \nmake sure no one else is looking at you when you smile, or else they'll \nthink you're a twisted son of a bitch. lol\xef\xbb\xbf"
p57
aS"That song he was singing was from a horror movie but I can't remember,was \nit insidious or what?????\xef\xbb\xbf"
p58
aS"The most important rule is gtfo.\nFollow my tips because im 9 but I've seen millions of horror films so yea.\n\nFirst of all if you see a face and the mirror and if you look back and it \nis still there grab the nearest thing close to you and hit the sh##t out of \nit.\n\nSecond don't be awake at 12 pm and go to the toilet. There probably be a \nlittle girl there trying to kill you or the scream guy would lock the door \nand kill you. The best way to avoid is to bring a weapon in and shoot them \nfor about 10 mins \n\nThat's all\xef\xbb\xbf"
p59
aS'One more thing.. nigahiga..... u need to work on your creepy face I mean \nseriously ppl are like.... um...wtf... like im only 14 and I could out \ncreep face u!!! and u should of showed the face from scary maze in the \nmiddle of "violin ted" it would of been funny and who cares if u r a little \nbit of a jerk.

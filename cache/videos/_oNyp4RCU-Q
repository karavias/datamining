S"I am a girl and I am a tomboy. I get judged all the time I get called names \nlike feMALE. I have been called a boy which neither bother me because I \nlike being this way. Anyways in my school they had all the girls meet up in \nthe auditorium then they were talking about girls and drama talking about \neach other and I'm sitting in the back like r u talking about. Because \nhonestly I don't go around and say like look she dresses like a slut look \nhow ugly that is is she like poor. So my teachers say don't make \nassumptions yet they are making assumptions that all girls are like this. \nI'm glad to say this even though it is very long I like to let people know \xef\xbb\xbf"

p51
aS"I'm pretty sure we discussed this during one of our bible studies. :)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p52
aS'I agree, but (not to be racist) black men in hoods who sit in one place for \na long time have a bigger reputation for crime and bad things. Im sure \nthere are people like that who are great churchgoing fellows, but most \npeople who sit around in hoods where people walk by are not that kind of \nperson. The little girl could be the same way, but little girls dont have a \nreputation for it and are much less likely to kill you if they attack you. \nSometimes judging a book by its cover is the safer way to go, but just \nseeing people walk by and judging them is wrong.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p53

p348
aS'You can\'t not judge someone. Humans judge other humans to determine if the \nindividual is safe or not. Humans don\'t judge someone if their "shady". \nThey judge them to see if they are different (therefore untrustworthy \nbecause it is unknown). Judgement is good. If you think someone might be \ndangerous, don\'t risk it. You might be right. Judging anything incorrectly \nis wrong, but judging someone correctly never is and never will be.'
p349
aS'Girls are really judgmental. ALWAYS ARE THEY NEVER CHANGE!!! Guys are \neasier to get along with. They are forward with one another, unless the guy \nis a scaredy cat. '

aS'ou should get to know the person first then judge them.. You should Never \nJudge a book by it\'s cover.. Judge it by the amount of pages there are \nbecause the more pages there are the more words there are, The more words \nthere are, the more irritating it is to read unless there\'s pictures. If \nthere\'s pictures then there would be less words.. but "picture is worth a \nthousand words".. so. so...

He then looks at you while you start walking past, you might think he \nis going to hurt you or something. Then you walk past and he gets up and \nstarts walking in your direction; now you probably will think he is going \nto mug you, and then later he mugs you. How a person dresses and looks can \ntell you something about them."

aS"Avoiding a big guy in a shady non public place is not judgement,it's smart \nbehavior. In all likelihood the girl could not rape you,and if she wanted \nto kill you then at least as a woman I would have a fighting chance against \nher,while the big guy could very well rape and kill me and I would have no \nchance at all. As a man you have no real fear of rape because you have a \nfighting chance against another man. It's not the same for women. So will I \navoid potentially dangerous situations? Yes !"

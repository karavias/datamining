aS"Ahhh... So that's why Goku appear at Naruto showdown with Sasuke....\nBUT WAIT\nIsn't Naruto world that Goku teleport to supposed to be just a trailer???\nBUT WAIT\nIt means Goku can teleport to a unreality trailer\nBUT WAIT\nGoku supposed to be able to teleport to another dimension, not another \nunreality world which doesn't exist\nBUT WAIT\nThe real deal was made by the creativity of the creator who make manga, so \nthey have some connection to each other\nBUT WAIT\nTwo different dimension which created by two different author that exist \ncan't transport another one to another dimension which are hold by \ndifferent characteristic and different world with different kind of style \ncan't be merge\nBUT WAIT\nBoth of the creator of the Naruto and Dragon Ball in here was make by one \nsame creator, Ryan Higa or NigaHiga\nBUT WAIT\nTwo of the video he create was in a different time\nBUT WAIT\n2 different videos can be merge into one if there's a connection in it, \njust like some anime called to aru majutsu no index and to aru kagaku no \nrailgun, because even the timeline and character is different, they live in \nthe same world\nBUT WAIT\nThere's only one Ryan Higa in this world, universe, and dimension, but \nthere are two worlds created by a different people which also live in our \ntimeline with different worlds and different story as well timeline, and \nhave different style and there's no connection in the fake world created by \nthese three people\nBUT WAIT\nGoku can move into another world and another universe, but he can't move to \nanother dimension which he ceased to exist, with different kind of power \nlike Chakra in Naruto, Rukh in Magi, Ki in Dragon Ball, every power doesn't \nexist in another world, which means he shouldn't be able to fly or go back \nto his world, universe, or dimension he came from, he wasn't supposed to be \nable to teleport to Naruto world in the first place due to the different \ntype of energy and different dimension in Naruto's world, universe, and \ndimension\nBUT WAIT\nDr Who succeed in moving on different worlds, which means different \nuniverse, which means different dimension, and was able to go back to his \nown world using the unidentified power that should be ceased to exist in \nanother world\nBUT WAIT\nEven if Doctor Who succeed in moving to another universe, doesn't mean he \nsucceed in moving to another dimension, and he wasn't able to teleport like \nGoku did\nBUT WAIT\nGoku and Naruto are different characters in a different dimension which \nhave power beyond that of a human, but Doctor Who is just an artist in the \nsame world and same timeline as us, but what he did is pretending to go to \nanother planet, which means he wasn't really moving in another universe\nBUT WAIT\nIf all of this are worlds that are made by different people, it means any \nnature law and psychic can be broken and replace by the creator of the \nworlds which actually and maybe ceased to exist, but exist in his or her \nmind, which he or she can project using mind and able to be shown to other \npeople using writing, playing, talking, or even in a Shape of a VIDEO like \nthis one\nBUT WAIT\nRyan Higa make this video in order to satisfy other people and make other \npeople happy and laughing, and getting subscriber at the same time for his \nliving cause he's a YouTuber\nBUT WAIT\nThe people who watch his video are all people who watch this video, who can \nbe anyone\nBUT WAIT\nThe one who watch this video can also be me\nBUT WAIT\nI did watch his video\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nIn conclusion, it all ends on me.\n...\n...\n...\nIf you're confuse, like.\n...\n...\nSo, Confuse yet???\xef\xbb\xbf"

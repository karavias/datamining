aS"The same with Indian dramas. But I guess it's counted under 'Asian'. But \nanyway, first they're in love, and they can't be together because she has \nto be with someone else, or there's some huge misunderstanding, or \nsometimes they get married from the start, and then when they get married, \nthe sister in law hates her and tries to kill her or get her out of the \nhouse, and then people die from falling down like, two stairs, or go into a \ncoma from hitting their head on the steering wheel of their car, and the \nboy and the girl go through drama... and most of the time, someone dies but \nthey aren't dead, and then there's more drama going on in every aspect of \ntheir lives. And when something is revealed, the camera must make a 'CHOOM' \nsound an flash (with a bright light) on the face of every. single. person. \nin the room ten times, and dissect their reactions and zoom in. While they \nfocus on one person, every time the camera zooms in, the same thing \nhappens... and the thing is, my mum is addicted to them...\xef\xbb\xbf"

In my opinion I just \nthink its very addicting because once you watch one you want to watch \nanother, but anyways I like the way you made the video look like a real \ndrama \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x91\x8c\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x91\x8f\xf0\x9f\x91\x8f\xf0\x9f\x91\x8f\xf0\x9f\x91\x8f\xf0\x9f\x91\x8f\xf0\x9f\x91\x8f\xe2\x98\x9d\xe2\x9c\x8c\n\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"I was wondering what foreign language was that lol. Your thought on the \ndramas may not be far from the truth but I think it has something to do \nwith what appeals to the demographic. I mean, American romantic series are \nabout changing partners like changing clothes, Asian's strive on misery \n(still at Romeo and Juliet phase). But! There are a few exceptions, even in \nthis genre of drama, and to find the rare gems, you just have to keep \nlooking ;)"

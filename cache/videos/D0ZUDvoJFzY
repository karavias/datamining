But there is other type of \nfootball, soccer. What major soccer event is coming up?  The FIFA World \ncup. Want to know when it was founded, 1930. Remove the first half of 1930 \nand you get 30.

aS'one direction!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p370
aS"Psy = Psyduck. National Pokedex number 54. But that's not the only thing. \nPsyduck was known for its intense headaches. And what do you do when you \nhave a headache? You take medicine. But to buy the medicine, you need \nmoney. And to get money, you need to work. But we learnt in physics that \nwork is simply force times displacement (or Fs). Therefore Fs = 54. \nHowever, using a bit of algebryan, we can find that s can also equal fifty \nfour over F. Fifty four OVER F. In cricket terms, an over is half a dozen. \nAnd what do you buy in dozens? Eggs. So we are now just left with s = \neggs/F. In order to get rid of the F on the bottom of the fraction, we just \nhave to multiply both sides of the fraction by F. So it becomes s = eggsF. \nBut we can make it even simpler. When you apply force to an egg, what \nhappens? It breaks. And what is the easiest thing to break? The heart. And \nwhat is the heart connected to? The brain. And what does the brain do? It \nquestions. So going back to our equation, we can substitute it in so we get \ns = question. Or if we dimplify it further, we get s = ?. SEQUEL?\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'To fill in gaps; from the "omg shoes" channel, they involve shoes and \ndresses, which are clothes you use to look better. What else makes you look \nbetter? fitness and dancing; like dancing on treadmills.\n\nthen to the "4D8", which wasn\'t exactly connected either; D is the fourth \n(4) letter of the alphabet, and what\'s the letters before that? ABC, which \nnumbers are 123. ABCD + 1234 = 8 symbols in total. But back to 123, Pokemon \nwas getting bigger and bigger around that time, with the announcement of \nnew games, which brings us back to "old favourites of Pokemon" like \nScyther. What sounds like the first syllable? Psy from gangham style. \n\nLet\'s continue; Gangham Style became popular "music" because it was "silly \nand stupid", but it also wasn\'t actually meant to be a popular music video. \nAnd what else wasn\'t? Just as it\'s nearing it\'s 1 bill view counter, what \ncomes out? Another piece of music that wasn\'t actually meant to become a \npopular music video;\nThe Fox.\n4D8, which I\'m gonna randomly say is the "surrounding-ness" of all YouTube \nvideos, (bc how else am I meant to link it?) has the number "8" in it. How \nmany times in The Fox are annoying noises made? 8.\nThe fox is mentioned as "beautiful" and other things; but some people \nprefer other words, like "cute", say for a fox, because it\'s a small furry \nanimal. You know what else is cute? Seeing cute couples; just like in the \n"First Kiss" video.\nWhen people go a bit too far with complex, they start drawing and writing \n"inappropriate" things about them, but some people like referring \ninappropriate things to a single letter; like "D", which they do to make \njokes in other social networking like Vine and Snapchat.\n\nDick is also a name. What is it short for? Richard. What\'s short for \nRichard? Rick.\nAt April Fool\'s day, a popular YouTuber named Ryan Higa (yes we\'re on his \nchannel. congrats) posted a video. Continuing the last trend and mixing it \nwith this video, the fact that Ryan is an Asian, and the last trend-making \nsequences, happened to make a video about rickrolling. The "Rick" from the \nlast trend, and the roll which deprives from, as Ryan states in another \nvideo, what Asians are commonly insulted with.\n\nSo, we\'re up to rickrolling. (Gonna use an idea from another comment, hope \nthey don\'t mind.) There\'s a lot of other words for roll, one of them is \ntumble. Where did most of the views from the "First Kiss" video come from, \nto make it apart of this sequence?\nSomething that sounds like tumble;\nTumblr.\n\nTumblr is starting to take control of YouTube; but what\'s the next trend \ngonna be?\n\nI\'ll be sure to make a connection.\xef\xbb\xbf'

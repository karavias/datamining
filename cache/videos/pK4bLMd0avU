Now \nwith how shitty the generations are getting with all of the people being \noverly dramatic, we can't seem to simply enjoy gems like this video.

aS'see, people today would now say this is offensive. but back then people \nwere way less sensitive\xef\xbb\xbf'
p33
aS'like if your watching this video in 2015\xef\xbb\xbf'
p34
aS"Yes, self harm is a serious issue. But, as the name implies they're doing \nit to them self. It's nobody else's fault, and most people nowadays just do \nit for attention. (I know some people actually are depressed, but I didn't \nmean everyone)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p35
aS'Guy I want us ALL to go back to 2007. Think about the teenage population at \nthe time. Please, because you all see this in the light of 2014 when in \nreality it\'s from 2007. Emo at that time was a fad. People dressed up punk \nand said they were depressed and hated their parents and "self \nharmed"(Which most people lied about because again it was a fad, and if \nthey really did that\'s completely fucked up) TO BE COOL. THAT WAS THE \nPOPULAR GROUP. This video doesn\'t make fun of the ACTUAL emotional people, \nbut rather the stereotype of the FAD back in 2007. I recommend not watching \nold videos if you don\'t take into account the time period that they made it \nin.  \xef\xbb\xbf'
p36
aS"I find this funny and hilarious. I'm emo (obviously my profile pic is 2007 \npete wentz) and I'm not offended :)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p37
aS"Is being 'emo' still a thing? \xef\xbb\xbf"
p38
aS"Lml he's hillarious!\nEmo ppl chillax its not directed to hurt you.. its a joke\xef\xbb\xbf"
p39
aS"I went through (still going through) phases of self harm but I love \nnigahiga and these videos are classic youtube vids. I don't see why people \nare being offended by them.  Everyone on youtube should know that nigahiga \nis a silly dude who doesn't mean anything offensive in his videos. He's not \nhere to talk about why self harm and being emo is a bad thing, he made a \nyoutube account to be silly and over exaggerate about things in a funny \nway. What I am saying is his videos are not meant to offend anybody. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p40
aS"I know this is offensive, and I want to be mad, but I just can't. I don't \nknow why, but this is too funny to be mad at, even though I know I should \nbe.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p41
aS'God damn, these videos are nostalgic, I remember watching these when I was \nin grade 5 in 2007.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p42
aS"This video was made in 2007. Back then, teens acted emo. They tell their \nfriends that they self harm, their parents hate them, they hated life and \nhated their self. But the truth is they were only seeking for attention to \nbecame popular. By doing so, people will started pitying them and care \nabout them and hang out with them and they would became popular. This video \nwasn't meant to offended anybody.. :) \xef\xbb\xbf"
p43
aS"No. That's Not How To Emo.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p44
aS'this isnt even offensive. what the heck?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p45
aS'To all you people being offended, yall are bitches.\nI had some problems in the past with self harm but I find this to be really \nfunny. Stop taking it up the ass, jeezuz\xef\xbb\xbf'
p46
aS'This could have been funny.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p47
aS"I'm Kinda EMO but this doesn't offend me. It makes me laugh actually. I \nhave been watching Nighahiga since I was 5 Years old. And This is not EMO, \nIts goth, EMO is Different\xef\xbb\xbf"
p48
aS'Say yeah of you watched this 7 years ago\xef\xbb\xbf'
p49
aS'Am I the only one who notices that most emos are depressed atheists? I \nmean, if ur an atheist, wouldnt u want to improve your only life while u \nstill got it instead of kill yourself? Or seek help? If your an atheist, \nthat means you have control over your life, not God, so frickin do it and \nnot have self harm problems and stuff..\n\nAnd if ur not atheist...stop complaining, and go get help (depression is \nrelated to some hormone thing, so frickin get actual help) or improve your \nlife and not spend your time thinking about how crappy your life is.....\xef\xbb\xbf'
p50
aS"I'm emo or whatever u wanna call it I slef harm I'm suicidal and I still \nfind this shit funny XD just cuz I know it wasn't meant to hurt people and \nif u find this video offensive then just don't watch it down make it a big \ndeal\xef\xbb\xbf"
p51
aS'people with "self harm" issues, have mental issues, that condition doesnt \nexist its for people seeking attention thats fucking retarded and i cant \ntake any of you dipshits seriously. you know how to stop that? you stop \nthat. wow problem solved youre life isnt bad. and if it was you wouldnt cut \nyourself to make it worse...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p52
aS'I find it quote offensive\xef\xbb\xbf'
p53
aS'Like if you think its annoying when attention whores comment on old videos \nand ask for likes if watching in 2014\xef\xbb\xbf'
p54
aS"This is offensive in so many ways. First of all, self harm is a very \nserious thing and shouldn't be laughed at or joked about like this. Second \nof all, a lot of this is either exaggerated or false.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p55
aS'i hate you guys you freaking suck\xef\xbb\xbf'
p56
aS'Its funny how this is "offensive" now but when i watched this in 2007 i \nthought it was hilarious. Weird how society has changed so much...\xef\xbb\xbf'
p57
aS'I remember, 2007, comment section was fun.\n\nI come back in 2014, "uhhhh y u do dis, dis iz insultin me pls m8 fuk u, \ndis iz naht fun fuk teh buliz"\xef\xbb\xbf'
p58
aS"Omg Ryan why? I love his videos but this is really offensive. We don't get \npissed off when something isn't the colour black, or cut ourselves in a \nfight, and no! It's not for attention either. I bet you guys would stfu if \none of your family killed them selves from cutting. That would wipe the \nsmile off you face.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p59
aS'I love how people are being offended by this, you all have to remember that \nthis was made six years ago. People were less sensitive and no one gave a \nshit.\n\nOkay ready for the hate\xef\xbb\xbf'
p60
aS"C'mon man yeah some of ur vids are funny but I'm like emo/goth and this is \nso innacurate and offensive think about what ur uploading\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"it's like their making fun of emo people. I'm not a hater...I am emo...and \nmost emo people don't like self harm...normally if they do...they a poser. \nEmo originates from the word Emotional. They don't over react to stuff. \nThey r emotional for their music. Have u noticed that most emo bands are \nactually REALLY good? Like Black Vail Brides? And I'm watching these Videos \nbecause I want to know what most people think about emo people.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"i may not be emo myself, but i still think that this video is a little \nmessed up. in all reality nigahiga is targeting a fairly large group of \npeople and just making fun of them by doing stereotypical stuff. isn't that \npretty much the exact definition of being prejeduce.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p116
aS"I'm someone who used to self harm for years and this didn't even offend me. \nPeople need to lighten up and stop taking everything so seriously and \npersonally. It's not making fun of actual depressed people. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'Ur just a loser that needs to get a life\xef\xbb\xbf'
p129
aS'I still crack my self up. Haha! Wish the commenting section was funner of \nhow it is, and not like it is today all people do is criticize and say \nstuff like "that\'s stupid" etc. And to all the people that take this \noffensive, cutting wasn\'t really a thing in 2007. If he made it now, it\'d \nbe bad & many people would dislike him, but now you can\'t dislike for that \nsince it wasn\'t a huge problem for teenagers. Ahhh I love Ryan higa\'s \nvideos !

p131
aS'Its the "emo\'s" fault for clicking on this video in the first place.

aS"Is it possible to be happy and sad about life at the same time? If yes, \nthan I'm living proof! If not, oh. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p136
aS"I  love Ryan Higa but this is just offensive. Self harm isn't a joke in any \nform or fashion. But I'm pretty sure he has matured by now and regrets \nmaking this video.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p147
aS'Self-harm is a serious issue and its a clinically proven disorder. You \nwouldn`t laugh or make fun of anyone with dyslexia or depression would you? \nExactly. It`s not attention seeking its caused by unbalanced chemicals in \nthe brain.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"To all the emo kids : is cutting yourself the only way out? Or is it you \nthat need to stand up and start fighting for yourself? Everybody has their \nbattles in life, sometime and somewhere. I got bullied before but it took a \nwhile to realize that everyone else's opinion don't matter - and I have \nmany close friends now.

p241
aS"This wasn't offensive, it was informative,\nAt least now we know that there is a mental illness that can make someone \nwant to inflict self-harm. Of course it was exaggerated to an extent but \naside from that, you can really realize what amount of pain is needed to \nfeel like slicing your own flesh is the last option.\n\nI'd imagine that the emo viewers would simply ignore it and move on simply \nbased on the fact that this video isn't fully true. It's the \nstereotypical-post yourself on myspace-I'm dying and want attention type of \nmyth.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p245
aS"Why do you guys even go out of your way to make fun of emos? Do you thinks \nit's funny? I think it's funny when your mom gets hit by a bus as half of \nher body explodes right in front of you and then your dog drowns because \nshe got stuck on seaweed.....yes we do keep to ourself so why don't you? \nYou may think it's over reacting but that's why it's called emo (stands for \nemotional if you didn't even know that dumbass) we are way more emotional \ntowards things that are personal not because glass gets dirty so if you \neven try to make fun of us make sure you actually understand what the fuck \nis going on before try and harass.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p256
aS"Wow people here are actually offended by this. Seriously, if you have \nissues you don't go on parody videos to complain, you don't cut yourself \nlike a retard, you go to see a psychiatrist.  \n\nThe 'emo' lifestyle shouldn't even exist, because that means you enjoy \nbeing sad and deppresive, which is fucked up. Or you just like to draw \nattention to yourself.\nPathetic.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p273
aS'2:18 his crying is hilarious! The old nigahiga days!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p274
aS"The only way I would think this is offensive is if it was someone's race or \nreligion, clearly it's not , it's just the difference between peoples \ncharacteristics, like at school there are the nerds, Goth's, populars, \ndruggies, emos, weirdos, jockies, and ghetto whatever you wanna call them.. \nBut i don't see discrimination against race or religion in this video.So \nit's not really harming anyone. Because no one was born as an emo, They \njust choose to become one.. The end\xef\xbb\xbf"
p275
aS'I have been watching ryan for 7 years and I have only now noticed that this \nvideo was made on my birthday xD\xef\xbb\xbf'
p276
aS"Umm... there's a joke... then there's an offending comment. Personally, \nthis feels offending. For all those people telling the angry people to let \nit go are obviously not emo themselves. This is discrimination. Would more \npeople be angry if he was talking about all the bad things that black \npeople do? How is that any different? He's still making fun of someone. And \nto think that recently he made a video on cyber bullying! hmph!\xef\xbb\xbf"
p277
aS'RYAN HIGA INVENTED TWERKING!!??!?!?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p278
aS"I'm emo and I found this really funny. Plus, self harm wasn't as big of an \nissue as it is now so back then people weren't as easily offended. This was \nmade in 2007 for  petes sake! Yeash....people need to chill. I love you \nRyan and I always will! <3\xef\xbb\xbf"

p301
aS"What I don't get is everyone on here with depression or anxiety or consider \nthemselves Emo, if you watch Ryan's channel you know its comedy and not \nserious and if you don't you could tell by the thumbnail or title that this \nis clearly a joke. It's your own fault for not only watching it, but \nwatching the whole thing. If you're going to watch something that's clearly \ntitled knowing you have an issue with it you have no right to complain...\xef\xbb\xbf"
p302
aS'I\'m guessing every fuck here bitching about how "offensive" this is is \neither from Tumblr or just unable to comprehend the concept of comedy. \nPlease, *shut the fuck up.* Thank you.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p310
aS"It's a fucking stupid sub-culture that isn't worth respecting in the first \nplace; if a bunch of other things get joked about, emo sure as hell will \ntoo; choosing to let yourself be over-emotional over dumb shit is a stupid, \nself-destructive decision. Your own decision.\nAs for the self-harm stereotypes, everyone has to deal with stereotype \njokes. No dumb sub-culture is exempt just 'cause its members are all \nchoosing to not get over things. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"My closest friends self harm, i get it. It's a serious thing to make of, \nbut if you go around labeling yourself with these kinds of names like emo, \ngoth, geek, nerd, jock, etc that is how you are known to other people. Self \nharm is nobody's fault but the people who do it to themselves. They made \nthe decision to cut themselves, nobody went and did it for them. Now before \nyou go and give me hate think about it, they could have made the decision \nnot to. Most people at my school do it for attention that it's seriously \njust pathetic. I understand that people have depression and deal with \nissues, but you can find help for that. Putting YOURSELF through more pain \nis not gonna help. \xef\xbb\xbf"

p385
aS'I used to be a clinically depressed teen and you should know that there is \na difference between being "Emo" and clinically depressed. Someone who is \ntruly depressed will not go out of their way to show off their angst, \nespecially by wearing all black, piling on make-up, showing off self-harm \nwounds and giving themselves a title.

I've struggled with self harm and suicide and \ndepression for a year now and I know that Ryan has as well but, it still \nreally offended me.

p426
aS"I hate to tell you Ryan, but this wasn't even close to funny. Yeah, I know \nyou were just kidding and messing around to make videos, but it was more \noffensive than anything. Also, cutting is NOT an Emo thing. The most pretty \npopular boy/girl at the school could do it and no one would know. It's sad \nto know people do it to themselves but making videos like this wouldn't \nhelp them. Half your subscribers could harm themselves and look to you on \nthe internet for a better day, and could have seen this and just cried. If \nanything it may have made things worse. Another thing is (I know this is \nhard for some to wrap their heads around) Emo is a music style. Some love \nit enough to make it into a fashion based off Gothic or Punk lifestyle and \nwhatnot, but Emo is just a music taste. If they don't already get enough \nhate from school or home or out in public... then here is another person in \nthe world picking on them. Now that my rant is over (and you would probably \nnever read this anyway), I want to put in no, I am not Emo, but most of my \nfriends are and I am Goth so it isn't too offensive to me, but I'm sticking \nup for my friends.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p427
aS"I get that this video is just a joke and I was laughing. But the thing that \nI am kinda butthurt about is some of the people in the comments. This video \nis just a joke, Ryan didn't mean it seriously (and also this was a long \ntime ago). So everyone dissing Ryan should stop. Also, everyone who keeps \nsaying that depression and self harming is stupid should just stop. You \ndon't know how it feels and you don't know what the people who have this \ncondition are going through. Maybe if you experience what they're \nexperiencing, you would change your mind.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p436
aS'You idiots cut yourselves for no reason and then when somebody points it \nout your all like OMG SO OFFENSIVE FLAG FLAG REPORT REPORT\xef\xbb\xbf'
p437
aS"Being emo and watching all these stupid videos about how stupid it is to be \nemo..just hurts. Thinking that people in my school also think that way. I \nexpected it from Onision to make fun of emos/goth etc but I did not expect \nit from Ryan. Although, this video is very old and he is really young here, \nI think that we shouldn't put too much hate on him, even though this is not \na joke to make on self-harm, because I have experienced it, and have been \nthrough alot of shit, I don't think we should hate on him because he was \nyoung and made a mistake. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p438
aS'shut the fuck up assholes! first of all he was just trying to be funny and \nthis video made me laugh....Second, cutting is for pussies, everyone has \nproblems, life is not fair, you need to deal with your problems instead of \ngoing to a corner and injure your own body,  and seriously most people do \nit because they think that they are cool and they dont even do it because \nthey are sad,this is why most cunts post pictures of their scars that they \nhave after cutting on facebook, they do it for the most stupid reasons.all \nthis emo shit is just a "fashion" piece of shit. they are people out there \nwith real problems  and remember be happy the way your life is because no \nones"s life is perfect. Again cutting is for pussies and people who hate on \nRyan because he made this video go fuck yourselves!\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'this video has so much views\xef\xbb\xbf'
p442
aS"It's annoying as hell that people use this video nowadays as a way of \nshowing off how much they've 'suffered' by cutting themselves or whatever \nin the past. First off, I can appreciate that some people have lived \nterribly difficult lives, but going around and flaunting it on youtube as a \nway of raking in sympathy is pathetic. If your life was really that \nhorrible, you should keep it to yourself. Secondly, saying that this video \nis offensive is saying what a hundred before you have already said. We get \nit, some of you don't like it, just move on and stop commenting. Other \npeople have beaten you to it. Lastly, it's pretty obvious some of you are \nsaying it's 'offensive' because you want to seem 'deep' and 'compassionate' \nbut you don't actually give a damn. Take your emotional crap somewhere \nwhere it counts, don't ruin a funny youtube video.\xef\xbb\xbf"

There are people dying because they \nhave nothing to eat, their houses are destroyed by Bombs, they see their \nchildren explode because of a grenade right in front of them! And all the \nemos do is sit in their nice comfy house with light, hot water, food, \nInternet, TV, clothes and they cut themselves or are depressed: no one \nlikes meeee :(( . seriously praise god and/or appreciate how lucky you are \nto be in the first world section...people take it for granted and have to \ninvent some mental problems and force themselves to think that they have a \nbad live..wtf is wrong with you?

aS'Ppl! i know that ppl who had to deal with self harming and stuff may find \nthis offensive but they were just kids joking! Dont forget that this was \nlike 7yrs ago!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p515
aS'this is so wrong in many ways and this suppose to be funny what if someone \nposted a video on how to be  asian like nigahiga would you be offended yeah \nyou would so stop labeling people and let people be who they want like \nJesus is this what the world has come to and the fact that people liked it \nand laughed at it makes this matter worse its sad to call this society \nthese days and you should seriously delete this video i get its for a good \nlaugh for people who are cold hearted loosers who dont have anything better \nthen the internet but the fact no one thought imagine if this was offending \nme i would be pretty mad or get really angry nope not one person so let \nthat sink in the next time you push the like button or laugh at anything \nlike this.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p516
aS'guys I know some people who do things that they make fun of but if you get \noffended by this then dont watch it your not forced to.I have gone through \nsome tough times but this is how I got over them I would make fun of the \ndepressing stuff in my life so if it hurts you then dont watch them I\'m \ntired of people saying that "this is so offensive" or "do you not have any \nconsideration for others?\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Cool good job\xef\xbb\xbf'
p518
aS'who is watching this in 2014 ? :\xef\xbb\xbf'
p519
aS'Reading all the butthurt emo comments is more funny than the video itself. \nI remember when this video was first posted and nobody was offended, but \nnow all of a sudden everyone is. It goes to show how weak everyone has \ngotten over the years. \n\xef\xbb\xbf'
p520
aS'I know everybody is like talking about how offensive it is, but look on 3:01 \nryan was twerking... \xef\xbb\xbf'
p521
aS'How do u get ur hair like tht b\xef\xbb\xbf'
p522
aS'Ok, here\'s the deal. I see it from both sides. A: This video could be \nincredibly offensive to someone dealing with these problems, obviously \nthese problems are very serious and can be fatal. A person living with \ndepression is really living day to day and is always on the edge, the \npsychological effect is similar to a soldier with PTSD, and can continue to \nhaunt people for several years, making this topic incredibly sensitive. But \nthen there\'s the other side B: Like Bo Burnham said "Tragedy will be \nexclusively joked about", to people who haven\'t experienced this, this is \nfunny. It\'s just how the world works, tragedy that isn\'t understood turns \ninto comedy, and sometimes, really funny comedy. Some of the best comedy \nhas roots in tragedy. This video wasn\'t meant to offend or to bully, it was \nsimply comedy being pulled from tragedy. You can also see that Ryan was \nmuch younger when he made this video, but now that he\'s older and that \nhe\'s matured, he probably can at least empathize for people in pain and \nhe\'s probably a little more careful about it. People should just be careful \nabout their jokes, tragedy based jokes can be the best for the right \naudience, but they require you to be more careful about what you say, \nespecially with an audience as expansive as the Youtube audience. That\'s \njust my look on it, food for thought. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p523
aS"To all the people saying this video is offensive: The facts aren't true and \nit's over exaggerated for a damn reason! He's just joking, so don't take it \nso seriously. :P \n\nAnd to the people saying how emos that cut are doing it for attention: You \nreally need to stfu. \n\nThat is all, have a good day.\n\xef\xbb\xbf"
p524
aS"Wow, this is just terrible, this is so rude and isn't funny at all. If they \nhad said this was intended as a joke and they didn't mean to offend anyone \nthan it would be a bit better but instead they acted like total ass's and \nmade fun of emo's with no other purpose than for attention, these guys are \njust terrible for making this video. And I hope they burn.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p525
aS'man can they twerk XD 2014\xef\xbb\xbf'
p526
aS'xD that ending blooper "throws ball headshot!"\xef\xbb\xbf'
p527
aS"Btw, it's true when people say that not everyone who cuts is emo. Crazy \npeople also do it, it'd be happy to give an example to whoever asks :D (and \nno. I'm not suggesting that I cut myself xD)\xef\xbb\xbf"
p528
aS'Jesus calm down this video was made 7 years ago cop on -_-\xef\xbb\xbf'
p529
aS'Oh, for God\'s sake people. Grow up. The comments are full of "This is so \noffensive." First of all, expand your freaking vocabulary, and second of \nall, Ryan was new to this all. Look at the quality of video, his lack of \npuns and acting. He didn\'t mean to offend anybody, I\'m sure. And another \nthing is that he\'s gotten older and wiser. Quit hating on him like you\'re \nthree years old. And most of all, IT\'S A GODDAMN JOKE. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p530
aS'Wow I thought the Emo subculture died out back in 2012. Apparently I was \nwrong. A lot of these people in the comment section seem pretty emo to me. \nDid the emo subculture make a comeback or something?\xef\xbb\xbf'
p531
aS'Aw this is so old!!! \xef\xbb\xbf'
p532
aS'aww i love you ryan i remember watching this with my brother and sister \nwhen we were little \xef\xbb\xbf'
p533
aS'Well I like a lot of the other vids, but this one is very offensive to the \npeople who are called "emo", they are emotional about stuff and cut because \nthey have pain and they don\'t know how to deal with, (I\'m speaking for \nmyself, others might be different) and I think this vid is very rude to \nthose people who have so much pain\xef\xbb\xbf'
p534
aS"eh whatever, most self-harmers these days are teenage white girls that \ndidn't get the right iPhone and decided to post pictures of the marks on \ntumblr saying they hate life\xef\xbb\xbf"
p535
aS'Wow i hope you idiots commenting know that Ryan knows what it feels like to \nbe depressed in his draw my life video he said he got bullied so much he \nwas thinking suicidal thoughts but then guess what? He built a bridge and \ngot over it. So hes been through it knows what it feels like and doesnt \nthink this would offend people its comedy you dont take comedy seriously. \nThats like saying in a cartoon when a character accidently jumped over a \nledge he didnt fall until he noticed he was in the air. Did that encourage \nyou to go do that aswell so you can see how it feels like to float? No so \nstop whining like a bitch and deal with your problems then come back to \nthis video and realize how fucking stupid you are to realize this offended \nyou. Case open for trial and error.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Ahhh so this is where twerking originated! \xef\xbb\xbf'
p543
aS'Note to all you emo dickwads that can\'t take a joke: \nOh, we\'re so sorry this video cwushed your itty bitty wittle emo hearts. \nGet your head out of your ass and take a joke for once will you? This video \nwas made for fun and laughs. Not for you raging emos to get offended and \npissed. Yes I understand some of the problems you go through being emo. But \nthat doesn\'t mean if someone makes a joke about it you should find it \noffensive. I\'m black, and if a white person said "nigger" I just laugh it \noff and get on with my life. He was just joking, why should I get all \npissed and butthurt? Goddamn, you people make a big deal over the smallest \nthings. \n\nAnd no this does not go to all emos only the ones that can\'t take a fucking \njoke.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"why do people self harm? i mean if you feel pain, wouldn't the last thing \nyou want to do is cause more pain \xef\xbb\xbf"
p547
aS"I think people are taking this too seriously! I do understand how it could \nbe offensive, but think about how old this video is, Ryan was obviously \nyounger and the internet was pretty new, so i don't think i would have \noccurred to him that this could be offensive. I can honestly still watch \nthis video and laugh even though I've know close friends who have gone \nthrough the same and it was emotional for me as well. i think people need \nto except that this is comedy and really isn't trying to malicious.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p548
aS"To all the people debating over this video, get the heck over it. It was \nSEVEN YEARS AGO. I've had issues with self harm before but this video gives \nme a reason to grow up move on. It shows how far I've come from a time when \nthis may have offended me ( for no reason) to now when I can laugh about \nit. I remember Nigahiga's videos making me laugh when other wise I would've \nbeen crying. If you don't like it, watch something else. If you do, give it \na thumbs up and move on with your day. All that other stuff is \nunnecessary. \xef\xbb\xbf"
p549

aS"This video brings back a lot of memories, of me watching it with my friend, \nlaughing every second, Ryan, keep doing what you're doing...\xef\xbb\xbf"

Well I'm not offended so bite me. So hit replay and keep \nwatching the god damn video until you laugh.\xef\xbb\xbf"

He's not offending people who have done/are doing self \nharm because they have mental issues about it.\nI've gone through the self harm phase and i was in depression and yes i am \nemo, i found this amusing at the immaturity t that completely generalises \nthe stereotype people think about emos and that's what this video is about \nisn't it.\n fucking hell calm down\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"I don't even recognize Sean\xef\xbb\xbf"
p590
aS"Back in 2007 (and the years before), being emo was becoming quite a trend \n(nowadays it's the same with hipsters). In my opinion the video is \nhilarious and sarcastic because in the end, the boy's life who turned emo \nstill is bad and he's oppressed. This shows actually that keeping to \nyourself and self-hate isn't helping yourself, but the bad persons around \nyou. I respect the whole topic of self-harm and people affected, but this \nvideo doesn't state that it's good and that people should end their lives, \nactually it says the contrary. And to the whole 'lifestyle emos' to stop \nwhining. While making that point, 'lifestyle eating disorders' also become \na trend. Again, I do take the topic seriously because I had problems \nmyself, but I never went out and glorified my behaviour.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p591
aS'How is this offensive? Seriously, your friends chose to be emo and have \nselfharm, which is completely retarded\xef\xbb\xbf'
p592
aS'He twerked in 2007\xef\xbb\xbf'
p593
aS"They got away with it back then, but now these annoying emos are here to \nhate on it today. He's never going to see these comments, so why bother \nwriting them? \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'so did any of the bully become your friend now Ryan?\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'OMFG!!! SO OLD WTF \xef\xbb\xbf'
p596
aS"While everyone's bitching, anybody know the name of the song? :D\xef\xbb\xbf"
p597
aS'So this video is offensive all of the sudden? I mean self harm is really \nserious, but this movie was made back in 2007, why start commenting about \nself harm now? \xef\xbb\xbf'

p609
aS'This was 6 years ago when they were young and did stupid things no need to \nbe so sensitive over something that happen 6 years ago come on guys\xef\xbb\xbf'
p610
aS'For everyone saying this is offensive, especially because they themselves \nare "emo" are so stupid. first of all, we know you are fake right from the \nstart because a person who is really struggling with self harm wouldnt \nlabel themselves as emo. and second, nobody made you watch this video, you \nmade a fully conscious decision knowing its content before even playing it. \nTo anybody who truly is battling with self harm, get yourself some form of \nhelp because only you are gonna be able to change that, nobody like these \npeople trying to stick up for "your cause" will be able to help in pretty \nmuch any way possible.  \xef\xbb\xbf'
p611
aS'I remember when I watched this so long ago thinking, "Hahaha this is so \nfunny!" Then I actually dealt with depression and self-harm and came back \nto this with the realization of, woah, this was a little much. But I don\'t \nreally care at this point, they were young and just trying to make a joke, \nnot too offended by it at this point.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p612
aS"I love these old videos <3. I don't understand why everyone is so offended. \nIt's comedy! Here's a bridge. Get over it. \xef\xbb\xbf"

Nowadays its taken \nvery seriously and many people suffer by it and its good that its taken \nseriously because it should. but if anything, this video is pure \nentertainment and just two guys doin what they think s funny, and it is to \nmany, and is not.

p677
aS'I agree with you Nikki \xef\xbb\xbf'
p678
aS'So many butthurt comments, "I self harm, that isn\'t funny."\nWell it\'s funny to other people and even people who have self harmed, it\'s \ncalled growing up and realising you\'re a little twat with more freedom than \nyou understand.\nNext time some prick calls you names, cut them, not yourself.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p682
aS'I saw this in 2007 or whenever it came out, and thought it was funny. Now, \nI see them making a joke out of it saying "emos" are miserable and make \neveryones day horrible. like no. please no. people are killing themselves \nnot because any of these things. this vid is triggering, and it has no \nhelp.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p689
aS"Everyone needs to calm their shit. If it's offensive to you don't watch it. \nReport it, or bitch about it on your blog but don't waste your time \ncommenting on a video you think is stupid or offensive because that's just \nplain dumb! Cutting is a serious issue, and so is depression but this video \nwasn't making fun of it, it was taking an issue many people know about and \njoking around. He didn't mean offense to anyone watching or anyone going \nthrough this. God, take a chill pill.\xef\xbb\xbf"

p693
aS'GUYS. This video is 7+ years old. Stop whining about it. If you suffer from \nemotional problems, then I highly recommend NOT clicking on videos titled \n"How to be emo" which is obviously going to be silly and satirical. C\'mon \nguys, be smart and don\'t hate on younger Ryan :)\xef\xbb\xbf'

p697
aS'This is WITHOUT a doubt the most horrible and most offensive thing I have \never seen in my entire life. I used to love Ryan Higa, but after watching \nthis I cannot stand him. \xef\xbb\xbf'
p698
aS'Yes it may be offensive but common you guys have a sense of humor\xef\xbb\xbf'
p699
aS"Lol. I remember back in those days, my sister and her friends used to watch \nthis video and Nigahiga back then. And fuck all you retards who are whining \nabout how 'offensive' it is, it's harmless fun he's making about emo \npeople. Emos are fucking freaks of nature and deserve to be made fun of. \nAnd if they self-harm, they deserve every bit of pain they inflict. \nSelf-harmers are weak, pathetic people and they should be humiliated. \nThat's not what nigahiga intended to do with this video, he was making \nharmless fun, but still, fuck you emos, you subhuman scum.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p700
aS"Ugh...this reminds me of my.....so called friend. She changed to emo for \nattention and to get boys. I have no beef against emo people but my friend \nchenged. And the reason I don't like her is because we used to date and she \ncheated on me....>:(\xef\xbb\xbf"
p701
aS"the first time I saw this I watched it back in 2007 but I'm still watching \nit in 2014 because it is funny xD\xef\xbb\xbf"
p702
aS'Hey, I am Emo/sensitive as well(tends to happen when you get abandoned by \nloved ones)-but Ryan Higa made this vid when he was like 15 years old-he \nwas an immature kid with a camera. His more recent vids are much funnier \nand considerate. Don\'t judge the guy. Also, no one can "make" you feel \ninferior without your consent-Eleanor Roosevelt said it, so it must true. \nTee Hee. :)\xef\xbb\xbf'

p714
aS'16k people were emo faggots\xef\xbb\xbf'
p715
aS"I find it funny how this video was made in 2007 and people know it's not \nreal because Emos don't really do this, and it's 2014 and instead of saying \nhow offensive this video is people should just not watch it if they find it \noffensive and FYI I went through self harm and I don't find this offensive \nat all\xef\xbb\xbf"
p716
aS'Ryan sure does have a sense of humor\xef\xbb\xbf'
p717
aS'hm how about instead of watching videos called "how to be emo" and \ncomplaining about it in the comments you go study for that spelling test \nyou have on friday!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p718
aS"i'm not sure why people are commenting on how offensive this seven year old \nvideo when there are much more offensive, recent videos. this one isn't \neven that bad\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'THIS GUY IS A COCK SUCKING FUCKING DICK !\xef\xbb\xbf'
p721
aS'34 million views for this lame ass crap?!\xef\xbb\xbf'
p722
aS'I love nigahiga, a lot, but this Video is kind of offensive. I know he \ndidn\'t mean it to be, and he was just being silly, but it is. I\'ve had some \nself harm and depression problems, but I\'m not emo. There are some people \nwho are emo, but they aren\'t depressed. Being emo is just a way of \nthinking. Emo people express themselves through different ways than \n"normal" people. I have nothing against nigahiga or this video. I\'m just \nsaying that people do those kinds of stuff that make fun of emo people. \nThey\'re not all suicidal/depressed, they\'re just emotional. I\'ve lost and \nalmost lost people to depression and isn\'t anything to make fun of. It\'s \nscary and I just wish people would stop teasing, and if they don\'t know how \nit affects people, just try and tell them.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p723
aS'I wonder how many of the people on here complaining have actually been \nPROFESSIONALLY diagnosed with Anxiety or Depression or have just \nself-diagnosed themselves. I am sorry, but depression is different to being \ndepressed and anxiety is different to being under stress. People don\'t cut \nbecause they are necessarily suicidal or "Emo". It is a form of connection \nback to reality due to the feelings associated with \nDepersonalization/Derealization (both are side-effects of severe \ndepression) or as a form of escape. In a way, similar to how people use \ndrugs or alcohol. People need to stop using disorder as a trend or to seek \nattention like a lot of the Emo/Scene kids do. Mental disorders are not \ncool. I doubt they know shit about what they are actually talking about. \nThe most offensive thing here is not the video, but all of you "Emos" and \n"Scene" kids who claim to have X and Y but don\'t have any form of evidence \nor legitimate explanation to what you have. Emos are a disgrace to people \nwho actually have these problems. Thanks to Emos, people with depression \nand anxiety can\'t go a day without being labelled as Emo just because they \nlegitimately have something that has now become synonymously linked to \nracoon-eyed angsty spoilt teens due to their constant complaining and \nattention-seeking. I think you\'ll find the video wasn\'t made to offend \nthose with mental disorders but to stir those who act it up and fake having \na mental disorder to get attention. Rant over.   \xef\xbb\xbf'

p732
aS'I remember back when we could just laugh at this because it\'s supposed to \nbe funny. Now a days people just find offense in it because everyone has to \nbe a little bitch about it. I guess I am considered "emo" and I can still \nlaugh at this video. Everyone needs to stop being so sensitive to every \nlittle thing.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p733
aS"This is so funny if you don't like it don't watch haters\xef\xbb\xbf"

Now I\'m not against emo. But it\'s like I \nreally really understand your parents abuse you , your friends left you \nI\'ve been there but maybe why it happened in the first place is because you \n" let " them destroy you like that , as I said you have two choices , deal \nwith it or cry about it. Life will always be hard but hanging slitting or \nbeing sad shouldn\'t be a choice , were all very young and have more to come \n, do something fun or try to make a goal & reach as high as you can so then \nin future when you succeed , you will be like omg wow I did it ! & be proud \nso yeah.. \xef\xbb\xbf'

I'll admit when I first saw \nthis video a long time ago I did laugh but now that I know what emo means I \nregret laughing because this video is far from funny, it's extremely \noffensive\xef\xbb\xbf"

Some people do need to man up, I agree with that completely. \nWhen we're kids we get pretty sensitive and blow things way out of \nproportion. Oh no my boyfriend dumped me! I'm 13 my life is over. Better \nharm myself. There are people in this world with real problems. And kids \ndon't appreciate what they have at all.\n\nAnd I can say all this because I self harmed for 7+Years. And none of that \nkiddy shit where I scratched my self from a paperclip. I have hundreds of \nscars and will probably have them the rest of my life. Looking back I think \nabout how much of a self centered bitch I was being. So everyone just calm \ndown. It is stupid to cut and we all know it.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p798
aS'Dear Emos, if you truly think that this video was offensive to you then my \npoint has already been proven, the only reason why you came to this video \nin the first place was to comment your life story and how this video \noffends you as an emo, it truly makes me laugh that there are people in the \nworld that complain about their depressed lives when they have access to \nthe internet, a cell phone, food, water, a house, a bed to sleep in, a \nshower, the list goes on forever and these faggots will still complain \nabout something, theres a saying for people that are true leaders, and its \nnot how many times you can hit back, but how many times you can get hit and \nkeep on moving forward.  Cutting yourself and being a prick to others \naround you is something that makes a pussy, and im glad to say that im not \none of them, and before you tell me that i dont know other peoples lives \nand whatnot, i dont need to, because i can guarantee that somebody out \nthere has it so much worse, so quit your fucking complaining emos and grow \nthe fuck up, because i sure as hell dont know any adults that are emo, if \nyou think im being an ass about this you are wrong, because all i am being \nis a realist\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS"Looking back at this, it isn't Ryan's best video. It's very offensive. But \nagain in 2007/2008 everyone made fun of Emo kids. I know I did. Then fast \nforward to when I actually delt with problems of self harm and depression. \nI'm not saying what Ryan did was good but again, back then, cutting and \nsuicide was very taboo. And Emo kids were just seen as attention seekers \nand kids who just over reacted. I'm not excusing his action but I doubt \nRyan will ever do a video like this ever again. It was his earlier years. \nHe has evolved as a youtuber and thinks twice before uploading. Just give \nhim some slack. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS"Does no one or at least very few people seem to understand that we laugh at \nthings that are depressing, absurd or strange to us as a COPING MECHANISM. \nOMFG, if you can laugh or enjoy a horror movie, you're engaging in the \nEXACT same behavior as this video could be looked at.\n\nAlso, more to the point, suicide is a serious topic, but at the same time \nit's also incredibly selfish (this is coming from someone who has felt like \nit and knows many people who have tried or felt it too.) Reason being is \nbecause when in that mind set, one does NOT think of how it affects others \nnegatively and only worry about their own misery, which I don't blame them \nfor because the brain as I said is a retard a good portion of the time, \nspecially with hormones and being misunderstood because you don't even \nunderstand yourself, but the point still stands, it's a selfish act and I \nthink the way we look at it should be as a mental instability and treated \nnot with callous or disregard, but genuine concern and willingness to \nunderstand why. That being said even in all seriousness it's HEALTHY to \nlaugh at satire of something that in reality is sad and depressing. The \nENTIRE point of laughter, it's to say that things are ok for our own \nsanities sake because if we saw the truth as it is, we'd all be miserable \n(discounting people with fucked up or no empathy of course).\n\nTrust me, if you actually looked at all the shit in the world and couldn't \nfind something morbid or bizarre to laugh at, you'd probably jump too. It's \ntoo much for the human mind to handle, and it's ok to laugh at say a body \nflying through the air hit by a car in slow mo to silly music, even if you \nunderstand the consequence of it. Humans can't live in sad/upset states all \nthe time and we NEED laughter just so we don't all completely fall apart at \nthe seams.\xef\xbb\xbf"
p832
aS"I sigh and looks at these comments. All of this needless arguing, people \nreferring to children in Africa to show that Emo problems are far more \ninsignificant. Then there are the ones that defend people that are emo \nmaking their points clear and obvious (though there are some that believe \ncutting themselves gives them justifiable reasons, but that all depends on \nhow badly they feel about their own lives)while there are the fools who \nsimply tell them that emos' are stupid because they don't know how to \nhandle life or merely tell them that they take this too seriously.  Of \ncourse you have the ones that simply  do not care. Ask yourselves \nwhich group you are apart of in this foolish dispute.\xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'The only thing I liked about this video was the songs. I\'d like to explain \nwhy I dislike the video:\nFirst off I\'d like to point out that yes I do know it is a "comedy" video \nbut it\'s not my sort of comedy.\nNow I would like to be slightly more serious on this context, "Emo" is a \nstupid term.\nThe fact that they said "Emos" like to self harm is ridiculous - the idea \nthat people get pleasure from self-harming (from what I know from the \npeople I know) is wrong. The people I know who I guess would be classified \nas "Emo" see that self harm is a way to relieve their stress - now I know \nas well as most that it\'s not the best way to do it - but it\'s the way they \nfind most effective.\nI\'d like to complain about the lack of sensitivity in this video as I don\'t \nthink it properly addresses the fact that they were trying to do it for \ncomedy and not as an insult.\nI know my views may conflict with a lot of people but I\'m not fond of this \nvideo and feel the description needs to be changed to be more obvious that \nit was an attempt at comedy.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Real emos \ndon't pretend to cut themselves, they cut themselves! Fail! There, that \nshould be enough of an insult to help you get in touch with your inner emo! \nNow go be a real emo and make emos proud! Oh wait, can emos be proud? What \nhappens when an emo becomes proud of something? Does the world end? Does \nHell freeze over? Is it actually possible for an emo to become happy? Whoa! \nthat's a scary thought straight out of the Twilight Zone! An emo being \nhappy! Now that's freaky!\xef\xbb\xbf"

Emo is nothing to be \nproud of so cut the crap and learn to accept comedy.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p904
aS'Oh, thanks for making fun of self-harming you asshat. I self-harmed it \nwasn\'t because I was emo or trying to fit an image. Not all "emo" people \nself-harm. But, it\'s great to know someone could be on the verge of almost \ncommitting suicide and you LAUGH.\xef\xbb\xbf'

Emo is short for emotional hardcore and is a subgenre of hardcore \npunk that began in the 1980s. In the 1990s, bands like Sunny Day Real \nEstate, Jawbreaker and Jimmy Eat World were coincidentally called emo due \nto their emotional lyrical content. Since the 1990s, emo has also had its \nroots in indie rock and pop punk. Bands like Texas is the Reason, Thursday, \nSunny Day Real Estate and Cap'n Jazz are all emo bands.\n\n\xef\xbb\xbf"

Emo does not mean wearing skulls and chains everywhere, it means \nhaving emotional problems that have taken a wrong turn and caused the \nperson to do something. For instance, last couple of years, both of my \ngrandmas died. Now in a sense I'm emo. I just don't get idiots these days, \nyou?"

My dream is to be an actor and i like to dance in public, but i cant \nget in performing school, and i just got 1,555 subs, which is pretty \nimpressive to me, but I'll never get noticed with these numbers.

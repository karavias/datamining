Unfortunately I \nwasn't a YouTube watcher, so I would not go out of my way to find more \nvidoes of the YouTuber. But two months ago I decided to check out your \nvideos and I felt really bad for not subscribing before. Despite the fact \nthat you have ADHD, which doesn't seem to stop you from making videos, you \ncontinue to make great videos that always put a smile on my face from the \nmoment it starts, to the very moment you say TEEHEE :D \nThank you for your videos, and i would also like to give a shout out to \nyour friends as well for assisting you, their contributions have not gone \nunnoticed. Even though you don't post a lot of videos nowadays, I still \ncontinuously watch the ones that are already up over and over again. \nI know that this is a long thank you, but I want to say that you are one of \nthose YouTubers that deserve each and every subscriber and more that come \nyour way. You make me and a lot of people happy and I really appreciate \neverything you do.\nYou truly are a wonderful person and I am proud to be a lamp ( I think that \nis what you call us, as you can tell I'm still new and getting to know you \nmore ). Continue to do what you do and *bleep* the haters ( keeping it PG \nfor your channel ). \nLove you and your friends, your kinda new subscriber, Mwelu :)\xef\xbb\xbf"

p840
aS'That was cool'
p841
aS'this may be the wrong video to say hes full of himself as hes saying thank \nyou for subscribing i mean the whole videos about thanking the viewers and \nall hes doing is pulling out things from previous episodes to show some of \nthe cool stuff hes done and by the way whats your problem even if a video \nisnt copy righted its not right to copy now clarifying im not saying they \nstole anything i dont know the whole story but how can you either theres no \nway to know for sure if they meant to steal an idea'

aS"and Phro Getigan you had the right message but came off as kind of a prick \ni mean sure hes being a hater but i dont think hes a F*CKING HATER and \ngrammar does not apply to what hes saying unless you want to get technical \n(please don't) so that point doesn't help what your tryin to say unless \nyour trying to hate on him and i doubt so because you were just defending a \ncool you-tuber (and it would be a bit hypocritical)"
p848
aS'Thank was so amazing'
p849

p925
aS'Chill about Joule Thief! He did well in the contest, but now he is gone. He \nwasnt eliminated coz of Ryan, it was cleat that Christine, Timothy, Jenna, \nPewds, Anthony and Ian didnt think he did very well. Stop hatin on Ryan for \nsomething he said.'

p941
aS"That's brilliant"
p942
aS'Loved it!!'
p943
aS'Did the shadow of the props create a thank you'
p944
aS"My question is how is it less original than everyone else's vids (besides \nfor Kloon's strange but entertaining cult vid). The 1st similarity was \nmandatory, using props, so joule deciding to go sentimental doesn't make it \na rip-off of Ryan's idea seeing as those factors were almost unavoidable. \nAlso, that logic would also then disqualify any of Will's videos seeing as \nhis whole style is just a being a crazier Ryan, or most of Bad Weather's \nvideos kind of being a toned downed Smosh style... "
p945
aS'Almost made me cry'
p946
aS'He looked through a box of past souvenirs and strategically placed them to \nspell out a special message. That description sums up both videos, \ntherefore your argument is invalid.'
p947
aS'amazing..'
p948
aS'TEE..TEEHE..TE..TEEHEE.......TEEHEE'
p949
aS"This is an awesome vid and everything, but I won't be able to look at it \nthe same way as I did before the whole internet icon, joule thief thing \nhopefully you'll bring up the topic and calm people down on your next video \n:/"
p950
aS'Stupid i dare u to say something rude to me see what happens and stupid \nvideo'
p951
aS'The reason joule thief is gone'
p952
aS'Did the sahdoe'
p953
aS'Hey Ryan, you have an action figure in this video. Toy Story had toys and \naction figures and that came out over decade before this. So according to \nyour recent fair and totally not egocentric logic, due to that minute \nsimilarity, this video must be a terrible rip off and probably should get \nyou kicked off of Youtube...'
p954
aS"You don't say?!"
p955
aS'Creative X3!!!'
p956
aS'At the end the shade was writed thank u'
p957
aS'Awesome'
p958
aS'that was like just freaking amazing dude. respect.'
p959
aS'So many teehee'
p960
aS'hahaha i like the teehee part lol '
p961
aS'oh my gosh that was awesome :)'
p962
aS"Chillax dude, he said that he did one similar. He never said 'you have \ntaken my idea and copied me' he said 'i've done writing with props, aswell.'"
p963
aS'That was so beautiful!'
p964
aS'Awww'
p965
aS'increadibly awesome! :D'
p966
aS'OMG'

p970
aS'LOVE IT..BEST EVA'
p971
aS'Ditto andrew rodriguez:) best youtuber ever!:D'
p972
aS"that was beautiful {': "
p973
aS"I kinda cried while watching this because I've been watching him since \n2007, I believe."
p974
aS"It's been great watching all these videos. Keep up the great work!"
p975
aS"I've been here since the beginning. That was an amazing year for me."
p976
aS'Dear Ryan, can you make a Teehee remix?'
p977
aS'oh then when was his first video huh'
p978
aS'uh that was not an infomercial. it was the prop challenge, some sort of "I \nlove you" video that was sentimental. apparently ryan doesn\'t like it '
p979
aS'how do i unfavorite videos?'
p980
aS"What's the name of the song"
p981
aS'Teehee jump scare?'
p982
aS'Yup and that position is definitely not for him!'
p983
aS'This is amazing!'
p984
aS"To everyone bitching over who is the best you tuber just drop the fucking \nsubject about pewdiepie and ryanhiga they're in totally different \ncategories and either way they couldn't give a fuck because they're filthy \nrich yes its awesome what they do but ffs if you were a millionaire you \nhonestly and naturally would just not give a fuck"
p985
aS"he spends his time editing his videos and he gives all his money away for \ndonations some people have different opinions and please respect other's \nopinions i think nigahiga and pewdiepie both deserve to be number 1 but \nthey don't really care if they are number 1 or not you'll probably flag me \nas spam but just respect other's opinion."
p986
aS"I see what you mean, and tbh I forgot those things, thanks for reminding \nme. But I'm just pissed of what he did because I think it was selfish. \nOfcourse I'll evelntually subscribe to him again but not for a while. And I \ndon't remember that thing you mentioned about season one so I can't really \nsay anything about that."
p987
aS'I less than three this video'
p988
aS'i never knew i was subscribed to untin a day ago'
p989
aS"Btw, I'm glad you never called me an asshole, dickhead, bitch etc or tell \nme to go suck someones dick or anything. It's nice to have an actuall \nconversation on the internet for once."
p990
aS'Damn this was really well done'
p991
aS'Exactly, his reason was simply because he had already seen better videos. \nHe meant his own video when he said "I have already seen a video like \nthat". He kept complaining about already making a similar video so he \nobviously didn\'t believe Alex about not seeing his video. I agree that the \nsadness feels abit forced, but that\'s not enough to kick him off the show.'
p992
aS'Nope. He just pointed the obvious. '
p993
aS'that was actually quite sad '
p994
aS'ARE U GENIUS OR WHAT ??'
p995
aS'omg sooo creative '
p996
aS"Oh that! But that wasn't a contestant video was it? Just a video from \nChristine, Ryan himself and the other Internet Icon contestants to Lana and \nthe brothers Riedell, right? Ps: Shit maybe that's where Joule Thief got \nhis idea from..."
p997
aS'Dammn since the very first of your videos your videos said teehee thats cool'
p998
aS"This video must've taken a while to make. Good job Ryan! Subscribed from my \nsecond channel (this one) to negate the losers who unsubscribed. Lol Have a \ngood one!"
p999
aS'Nps! :)'
p1000
aS'Im a higga fan fan but seriouse ryan you seemed like a doosh bag when u \nkiked joule theife just because u ""think""he stole ur video'
p1001
aS'Dude when I watched this video I almost teared up'
p1002
aS"y did ryan hate the idea that joule thief's video was better than his "

aS'And btw, I\'m "hating" on iJustine and Timothy as well: iJusting complained \nabout youtube being made to laugh which is a bullshit reason. Timothy was \njust a fan of Will and didn\'t want him kicked of the show so he voted for \nWill. I believe I\'m speaking for more than myself when I say the reason I\'m \nmostly picking on Ryan about this is becuase I havn\'t been subscribed to \nTimothy and iJusting for five years so I don\'t really care about them.'

p1033
aS'no ryan...thank yu for being amazing '
p1034
aS'This video touched my heart'
p1035
aS'LOL, calm down know-it-all. What I was trying to say is that Ryan was \ntalking to Alex like he was the creator of that idea, when internet icon \nalready did it and so many other videos. And I think that the little boy \nhere is the one who insults, grow up.'
p1036
aS'JT FTW!!!!!! RH FTL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'

aS"And birden what what do u expect he's a judge and judges kinda have to \njudge...."
p1039

aS'tht waz sooooo COOL how he made it say THANK YOU just with his props'
p1041
aS'Just do another Rustin Hieber video and all will be forgiven'
p1042
aS"i don't think I like ryan as much as I used to. ever since I started \nwatching internet icon you can see he's kinda a jerk"
p1043
aS"To all those 'I just unsubscribed' people in the comments: we don't need \nyour life story. You unsubscribed. So what? Jokes on you cos you're gonna \nmiss the great videos he does. And also, Ryan is intitled to state his \nopinion in Internet Icon. He thought it was similar to his vid. So what? \nEveryone's whining and complaining comments of people saying its not even a \nbit like his videos. Grow up. It reminds me if 5 year olds."

p1046
aS'Why is everyone getting so mad because someone got eliminated in some show? \nGet over it -_-People these days...'
p1047
aS"lol? One is a 'comedy'? There are no comedy in both videos, the concept of \nboth videos is the same."
p1048
aS'Your soo creative!!!'
p1049
aS'No thank you for making us all laugh at your funny jokes, some people are \nreally sad, like me cause I used to be a gangster but then my cousin died \nin a shooting so then I stopped n today marks the day of 1 year of being \ndead. So thanks for doing this vid'

aS'Awwwwww!!!!! xD i 3 this'
p1052
aS"One of the most creative man I've ever seen."
p1053
aS"I'm sorry. This is almost the same as JT. I know he didn't even mean to \nhave it exactly like this, so I'm not hating. It starts out with a box full \nof weird stuff, has flash backs of every single one of them, and in the end \nspells them out. I mean I can see why Ryan was a little ehhhh with the \nvideo."

p1085
aS"Let me clarify some things. 1. Ryan, Christine and Tim all voted Alex out. \nSo Ryan isn't the only one to blame. 2. Alex actually did have a really \nsimilar video to Ryan's. They both look into a box, then have multiple \nflash backs and at the end if the video have a message with the items. The \nstories were totally different but with the same concept, something you can \nsteal. 3. People saying Ryan copied the same thing from Season 1 that is an \ninvalid argument as well because he did that with them."
p1086
aS'Love you, Ryan! Been watching you for years like wow. Haha.'
p1087
aS"awww that's cute welcome"
p1088
aS"Lol RJINCORP the idea and concept is all basically the same and Ryan wasn't \ntrying to be a douche it's just that like he said he's already seen and did \nthe video so it didn't appeal to him geez there's no reason to unsubscribe \nbut it's your loss"

So sorry for my terrible spelling. \nLet me get this straight, I said not to cuss and you did. And why are you \nso mad at NigaHiga? Christine and Tim also voted Joule Theif out as well so \nwhy are you mad at Ryan only. I dont see you making hate comments on Ryan. \nPersonally I think Alex's video had the same concept as Ryan's but a \ndifferent story. You need to stop swearing and grow up. "
p1092
aS"Ryan, I always watched your videos when I was smaller to be honest I'm only \n11. You inspired me to let out all my craziness and laughter. You are and \nalways will be my favorite Youtuber, comedian, or whatever you like to call \nyourself, in the world. So I'm thanking you! <3 Keep it up!"
p1093
aS"That's kinda Cheesey but nice"
p1094
aS'I like how you said "invented" it because that isn\'t the right term. In \norder to invent something you must patent it. A video idea isn\'t an \ninvention. Oh yeah you make yourself look good saying that with cussing, \nyou wouldn\'t happen to be a 9 year old boy would you? Nah I think you\'re \nreally stupid. '

p1098
aS'Your welcome Ryan'
p1099
aS'For anybody unsubscribing from Ryan because of the his reaction to the \n"similar video" by Joule on Internet icon, can you please stop \noverreacting? The video, whether copied or not copied directly, wasn\'t what \nRyan as a judge was looking for. The choice of staying or not staying \nsubscribed of course is yours of course, but just think about why you\'re so \nangry at Ryan for doing something Simon Cowell does far worse and more \noften.'

aS"For all the people in the comments arguing over who is better between Pewds \nand Ryan: I believe that all YouTubers are equal. This applies to me, you \nand any other YouTuber who posts videos for their audience. I don't judge \npeople on how popular they are on this site. I judge them on if they can \nmake me smile or make me think in another way after watching their video. \nSo what if Pewds has over 1,000 videos and Ryan under 200? They are two \ntotally different guys. They both started with 0 subs.."

p1133
aS"Alright I won't argue with your first sentence as clearly you'd probably \nhave watched more reality TV shows than me. But let me ask you this. Do you \nthink that they'll go so far as to make someone give a very biased opinion, \nto the point that one good contestant gets kicked? Cause that won't make \ntheir own show interesting but it'll only get their shows to be hated.. \nwhich they won't gain any good from that. I'm not trying to prove anything \nhere but think about it."
p1134
aS"Why would he act in a reality TV show to the point that one contestant to \nget kicked off from it? That would make internet icon a very unfair show. \nHe sure is a nice and humble guy but no one is perfect. What he did to Alex \nwas real and we all had the rights to get angry towards Ryan for it. Of \ncourse we all love Ryan and I still do. It's not like we're forever hating \nhim but it's also our job to give Ryan a piece of mind if he did anything \nunpleasant so he could get his act back together."
p1135
aS"The one of season finale, when they spelled congrats in the video, and \nplease spell right. And not i'm not a fangirl, I did not even like Joulie \nThief that much, but it pissed me off when Ryan said that bullshit. "
p1136
aS'Thanks'
p1137
aS". . . Think about a couple who would shout at each other when something bad \nhappens and they broke up because of it.. then later on they made up \nbecause in the end they still love each other. Sure some people might want \nto unsubscribe right now but I don't think they'd be gone forever. Hence \nwhy I said their anger will die out. . ."
p1138
aS"It's funny because the Kloon's video wasn't similar to anything. Ever."
p1139
aS'All this hate on Ryan is so irrelevant, eventually Alex and Ryan are gonna \nbecome good friends just like how he became friends with season1 \ncontestants like fu, lana, the riedell bros etc'
p1140
aS"I've never seen a staged contest before. A reality TV show is supposed to \nbe real, duh, as the name implies. What happened in the internet icon was \nreal otherwise they have no rights to call themselves a reality TV show. \nYOMYOMF would just be a scam if that's the case."
p1141
aS"I don't think it's an overreaction. If you watch the whole two episodes, \nyou clearly hear Will Paco saying 'I will copy the FU, because i'm asian \nand I am allowed', and he got away with it. Joule Thief didn't purposely \ncopy Ryan, and Joule Thief was a better contestant than Will. So I think \nmost people are just upset with the 'injustice' (yes it is a bit of a \nstrong word but I can't think of an alternative) to what happened on \nInternet Icon, and Ryan Higa is to blame due to his influence"
p1142
aS"I can tell you're a fan of Ryan with the way you're being so protective of \nhis actions and talking for him. For that case I think your arguments are \ninvalid since they're clearly biased"
p1143
aS"I see your points here but I'll still stand a middle ground to whether he's \nacting or not. I still don't see why getting themselves the hate and \ndislikes will result in increasing views. Sure some people might only go to \nthe video and check what happened to Ryan, but there are already people \nunsubscribing to yomyomf just because of that. Some are even not going to \nwatch internet icon anymore. I can't see anything but downsides for this, \neven if Ryan was really acting."
p1144
aS"And when I said we all love Ryan I'm trying assuring you that the hate will \neventually die out. No one is going to hate Ryan forever just because of \none mistake he did out of all these times but just for now they do have the \nrights to voice their rage towards it."
p1145
aS'7 years so what? Many celebrities and politicians could do that for their \nentire lives. "what would be the point for him to act nice and friendly", \nso that he\'d become more likable and gain more subscribers, it all comes \ndown to MONEY.'
p1146
aS"Guys, stop hating on Ryan, just because of one decision. Maybe he was a \nlittle jealous of Joule Thiefs, but who doesn't get jealous of someone that \nhas the same concept! Imagine you made a video that you love and think is \nunique, and someone makes a similar video, would you be jealous? This is \nONE decision of his and for some people you think it is a mistake, you need \nto forgive and move on."
p1147
aS". . . Also If some people are really really hating on Ryan and \nunsubscribing, they won't come back here anymore so why are you bothering \nwith those heartless ones? Ryan doesn't deserve those kinds of people in \nhis channel and all the better that they'll be gone from here."
p1148
aS"to those who are saying this video is not similar to joule thief don't know \nwhat they are talking about. The thing Ryan said in internet icon is that \nstuff like having the props in a box, the memories of each item and the \nspelling of a word using the props made the videos SIMILAR. He didn't \nnecessarily say Joule copied. Yet, still eliminating Joule because of the \nvideos similarity is wrong. This proves Ryan has a big ego. "

p1182
aS"You're still a retard. Can't you count, there are two other judges that \ndidn't like it as well. If someone made a video similar to yours, you would \nbe crying and bitching about it. And where did you get your stats? Maybe \nyou pulled it out of your ass because how would you know he lost that many \nsubscribers at that time."
p1183
aS"I'm pretty sure most of the people hating on Ryan have been watching his \nvideos for years, or barely know him well enough to let one mishap change \nyour whole perspective on the guy, I don't know about you guys, but I've \nbeen watching Ryan ever since he started and is this whole douche judging \nthing really a big deal?! If I recall Ryan has been in countless videos and \nthe one where he acts like a douche for a minute or two, he gets hated by \npretty much everyone, it boggles my mind"
p1184
aS'Yes, I am. JouleTheif still deserves to be in the competition. His video \nwas very good and better than Will Pacarro. I still like Will but he \ndeserved to go home.'
p1185
aS'That is soooooo creative!!!! I love it!!!!'
p1186
aS"Guys just because of his decision on Internet Icon , ALOT of people \nunsubscribed him . Before that episode where JT gets eliminated, Ryan had \n9,176,000 Subscribers .This afternoon , Ryan had 9,126,000 . It \ndropped...ALOT! Now , he has 9,146,310 ! Its increasing! Anyways , my point \nis , is that don't unsubscribe to Ryan just because of his decision.I was a \nJT fan too...and now im sad...but stilll....#Higaholics"
p1187
aS'You people are honestly insane'
p1188
aS"Ha! You're still sore about the elimination. Get over it you fucking loser."
p1189
aS'Wow Alex really copy that video. That a copycat'
p1190
aS"Im not hating on Ryan, but I've watched his videos for years and I've never \nseen this one before. And I believe that Alex didn't see it too"
p1191
aS"But see the thing is, he would never make a video similar to mine. I have a \nhigh doubt he does Graphics/Art. I think Tim liked it, just he didn't like \nthe fact that it was forced sadness. There are videos out there to force \nsadness Eg: Rememberance videos."
p1192
aS'I do feel Will should of went home but also thought joule theif could of as \nwell. The video is so damn similar. Box of props, being out a prop and \nflashback followed by a message written out in props at the end. The whole \ngeneral concept was the same'
p1193
aS'he lost around 10,000 or 20,000 XD he definitely deserved that, unless he \npublic apologizes for being inconsiderate'
p1194
aS"douche? wow you're even worse"
p1195
aS"Dear Ryan , Can you please make a video response as to why you hated JT's \nvideo so much? Just so we can get this clear to the haters right now..."
p1196
aS'But he did complete rag on a video that Joule Thief put a lot of effort \ninto and also completely discredited it, as well as pushed the judges to \nkick him off the show for being creative. He deserves some of the hate hes \ngetting for probably making JT less confident in his work'
p1197
aS'Get over it butthurts'
p1198
aS"Ugh whatever asshole. It seems that you can't handle a simple opinion, so I \nguess you've earned your place as an immature dick. Goodnight dick"
p1199
aS"Replying back to me is talking to me you dipshit. Your numbers are wrong \nbecause they don't come from a reliable source, which is you who is \nretarded. Ryan does have a lot of say in the votes, but Tim and iJustine \ndidn't like it either. You're still and always will be a retard. End of \ndiscussion. Good Night, retard. "
p1200
aS"That's one long ass sentence."
p1201
aS"Everybody just stop hating on Ryan. I really like Joule Thief and i don't \nthink he deserved to go home, but everyone has to go at some point. The \nvideos are similar, and even though i don't agree with Ryan, I respect what \nhe said. I understand him, and even if you don't, it's his opinion. he does \nnot deserve all this hate. Ryan, I love you, please don't listen to the \nhaters <3"
p1202
aS"We don't know if that's exactly how he meant it. I don't think he meant it \nin a mean way. JT did have the same idea, but lots of people do. I \npersonally think that Ryan wouldn't be that shallow and that it was \nprobably edited to start drama. "
p1203
aS"Oh i like his videos, you overly protective asshole, but he made a mistake \nand should own up to it like any other adult figure. Plus he did lose about \n30,000 at the time of the video but his channel constantly grow in \nsubscribers, like pewds or smosh. So if you wouldnt mind trying to be less \nof a bitch, that'd be great ;)"
p1204
aS"You guys need to get over it! What happened, happened and can't be changed. \nNo matter what you say the videos are completely similar and there were \nother reasons as to why Alex was eliminated. Remember Ryan isn't the only \njudge. And maybe Alex didn't see the video and he wasn't lieing the concept \nof the video isn't original. I wanted Alex to stay too but honestly... GET \nOVER IT. Ryan is still one of the best YouTubers around so grow up and \nleave him alone. Btw Ryan I loved your video ^.^"
p1205
aS"Ok you all are saying like stop hate on Ryan. But like I have seen Internet \nicon and Ryan was kind of right. I don't think joule thief copied him but \nthe videos are very similar. And what about the other judges tim had A \nopinion to and Christine they dident like it. Ryan is not the only person \nwho did not like it. Ryan's not the only judge. So stop hateing Ryan cause \nits not his fault. Joule thief went home it sad but it's ok. So don't \nunsubscribe and dislike. Rember the good things Ryan did h"

p1230
aS"It's really hard for me to pick my favorite video . STOP MAKING IT SO HARD \nRYAN . Wait don't stop ."
p1231
aS'it doesnt matter if i would have seen JTs video with or without knowing \nRyan higa. his comment on JTs video implies he thinks his is better. plus, \nthis isnt the most original idea anyways, he cant claim "take items out of \nbox + memory" is his idea. plain egotistical. and also, ryan wasnt "just \nsaying", he eliminated JT for copying him. that is why everyone has a \nproblem. '
p1232
aS'And just to let u know Ryan made this in the last 7 months not last 6 months'
p1233
aS"Ryan is there to say what he thinks , JouleThief already accepted it why \nwon't you and about the vid Ryan said that it was similar and it is but \nthat he doesn't think he copy him . Maybe Ryan influenced the other judges \nbut"
p1234
aS'And this is what you think Joule Thief copied? His was quality work in \n6hours. This is crap for who knows how long you took. I am so \ndissappinted...unsubscribed.'
p1235
aS'Dear Ryan, can you be less of an arrogant arse?'
p1236
aS"Can I just ask, am I the only one to see where Ryan is coming from when he \nwas talking about the similarities of Joule Thief's video on internet Icon? \nI know Joule Thief didn't mean for it to be so similar to Ryan's video, but \nyou have to admit, his video was extremely similar with the format. No need \nto spam Ryan's video just because he spoke what was on his mind, he's there \nto judge the video, and if someone has a video like another You Tubers, \nThat's something they have to take notice on."
p1237
aS"apparently Ryan plays a big role among the judges to see who will be \neliminated. If Ryan said that he liked or didn't like a video all the \njudges would agree with him. "
p1238
aS"There are three things similar, the box, the memories, the writing. so yeah \nI sill believe that he didn't steal the idea, ryan was mistaken but don't \nhate him too much, Joule's video -for me- wasn't top anyway."
p1239
aS'And infomercials are creative? BWF'
p1240
aS'go look at a show called internet icon on yomyomf and find the newest video'
p1241
aS'CAN SOMEONE LINK ME TO THIS VIDEO WHERE RYAN IS APPARENTLY A JERK?! '
p1242
aS"Actually, the judges didn't like how sad it was and said the sadness seemed \ntoo forceful. Look, I like Joule Thief too, but just because he got \neliminated doesn't mean it's Ryan's fault."
p1243
aS'JTs video is much better than this pie'
p1244
aS'And for the people that say Ryan copied JouleThief , you are just retarded'
p1245
aS"Moneyiseverything you can't judge by overall, that's like saying Joule \nTheif copied him, because his video was in the range of 1second- 6hours"
p1246
aS'I honestly believe Ryan did a horrible mistake. He calls JT\'s video \nunoriginal and starts to criticize every aspect of the video, making the \nother judges call it bad. Before Ryan said anything, iJustine had positive \ncomments. The other videos had no criticism, only saying " haha, Funny \ndude, perfect". '
p1247
aS"We are upset mainly not because of the fact that Alex was eliminated, but \nthe reason behind why he was eliminated. It's ridiculous for Ryan to say \nthat Alex copied his video, that's simply a false accusation. And those \njudges said that they'd keep the person who would likely to do well later \nand the next challenge is to make a trailer. You honestly think that Will \ncould make a better trailer than Alex? Alex's submission video is a trailer \nfor fuck's sake!!!!"
p1248
aS'Reputation takes a lifetime to build but only a second to destroy. '
p1249
aS"Like 3 days ago i discovered JT by his draw my life vid. Then I started \nwatching other funny vids - Ryan's vids were the ones i watched the most. \nSo yesterday I was reading comments after watching this vid and discovered \nhow Ryan eliminated JT from Internet icon. Two of these people have the \nbest vids for me recently. Why did JT have to be eliminated/eliminated be \nRyan?"
p1250
aS"That's so cool and sweet"
p1251
aS'This is soo Mzing the things you do and the originality'
p1252
aS'I actually subscribed yesterday to your channel :D'
p1253
aS"Sorry to interrupt, but why not we just enjoy ourselfs with the videos and \nstop arguing about who should be top on youtube, just be glad that Ryan is \nsomewhere in the top 10 subscribed channels. I'm both a bro and a fan of \nRyan, the right thing to do is just be glad and stop talking about this \ntopic, Ryan would not be so happy of us arguing about this, neither Pewds, \nso just move on and forget about this.

p1278
aS'Fair enough. Thanks for not blowing a gascet at me and actually trying to \nget the message across without calling me a bunch of names.'
p1279
aS'I hate how everyone is saying Ryan wasn\'t the only judge, no shit. The fact \nthat Ryan didn\'t give Alex the benefit of the doubt and didn\'t like it \nbecause he already saw a similar is fucking stupid. And based on the whole \ncompetition, the judges basically said Alex was the better competitor. The \nelimination feels like it was solely based off Alex "copying" Ryan'
p1280
aS"Damn Ryan. You said you didn't care for Alex's video... But said it was \nexactly like yours. So you do not like your video? Or were you just being \nvindictive.. because 2 separate people could NEVER possibly have the same \nidea... Nope, no way, never. /SARCASM"
p1281
aS"Yeah you're right, it is a good idea I guess, but I meant that it doesn't \ntake a creative genius to think this up like Ryan thinks himself to be. I \nstill like Ryan I just lost some respect for him when he just made those \naccusations about copying his video. If he had some better reasons to \neliminate Jouletheif, then I'd be okay with it. But this was a bad reason \nto eliminate him and I'm sure this isn't even an original idea of Ryan's."
p1282
aS"I have more of a problem with Will Pacaro(not even top ten material) still \nin the competition, than Ryan's opinion, although I don't agree with it. "
p1283
aS'There were other judges too and compared to what Ryan thought, which was \nreasonable, since we all can somehow see the similarities. Even if \nJouletheif didn\'t copy (which he didn\'t, of course), you can\'t blame Ryan \nfor thinking so initially. He did at the end, said that he trusts \nJouletheif. I believe the other judges were the ones who are totally \nunreasonable with their critiques. Like "I\'ve seen sadder" or "I don\'t want \nto be sad on Youtube" bullshit.'
p1284
aS'do u actually think joule thief copied u, wow taking ur judging personal'
p1285
aS"Don't offend Ryan r you get kicked off the show"
p1286
aS'fuck you. the only one hating is ryan.'
p1287
aS"Maybe I am, but the more subscribers\xe2\x89\xa0better videos. Jouletheif just got \nstarted on youtube and he makes great videos that I like more than a lot of \nRyan's. I still like Ryan and I'm subscribed to him but I just lost some \nrespect for him after he blatantly accused him of copying his video which \nI'm sure isn't completely original. Maybe I shouldn't have used this \nopportunity to attack Ryan, because I think he is talented and I enjoy his \nvideos. Btw it's funny how that guy can't detect sarcasm."
p1288
aS"Just because you have a similar video (which I am sure he hasnt seen) \ndoesnt mean he didnt try his best Joule Thief has shown possibilities to be \nthe internet icon and u didnt give him a chance but Will (an awesome guy) \nwho never won a challenge gets 3! chances that's not cool I KNOW YOU GUYS \nARE JUDGES AND ALL BUT WHAT YOU FOUR DID WAS A DOUCHEBAG MOVE"
p1289
aS'Joule Thief was better than this piece of shit. disliked'
p1290
aS'worst judge ever'
p1291
aS"Ryan is smart, he makes videos all the time.. don't all of you guys think \nthat he just wanted ya'll to comeback to this video? Probably for more \nviews or maybe even to thank you too for watching not just his videos but \ninternet icon's too... =)) (I mean you must have seen it coming, with all \nthe video playbacks while judging, and how he keeps on saying it.. if only \nhe added a wink..hmm or did he?) Basically they just pushing Will to \nsurprise people and be like a dark horse ^^"
p1292
aS"Yes it's similar to JouleThief 's video but you shouldn't talk to him like \nthat because he might get embarrassed or something like that"
p1293
aS'Keep the butthurts coming'
p1294
aS'at least joule thief made us feel emotional rather then just show his \nspecial effect skills that 1000000000000000 people can do!!! just saying '
p1295
aS"Yes, I'm really annoyed at Joule Thief's elimination. And I'm a little \nannoyed at how Ryan reacted to his video. But I'm not hating on Ryan. Sure, \nhe didn't act the best way about it, but not everyone is perfect. We all \nmake mistakes. And we can't always get what we want. Especially with \nreality competition shows."
p1296
aS'you guys keep saying to unsubscribe him .. but you guys can see his \nsubcribers gain every minutes ... haters gonna hates .. so fuck off please \n:) p/s sorry for my bad english'
p1297
aS"guys calm the fuck down. ryan said one fucking comment and now you guys act \nlike he's the sole reason joule theif left' its not his fault guys"
p1298
aS'@chu poka We can unsubscribe if we want to it doesnt mean we are childish \nthats the point of youtube to follow who we like and honestly in my head I \ndidnt think Ryan was a douchebag but after seeing all of the internet icon \nvideos and this last it shows that he has an ego and if I dont like that I \nwill unsubscribe and leave him alone I think its better than to keep \nbothering him over all the crap'
p1299
aS'thats exactly it!! just because those two are somewhat the same, dosent \nmean you should judge them differently '
p1300
aS'Everyone shut the fuck up about alex already. Whats done is done. They both \nhave amazing videos. Stop spamming ryan with hate and just spam alex with \nlove. Because ryan may have not been the most humble, but you guys are \nreally pulling a dick move. One moment of doucheness out of Ryan and the \nworld goes crazy. Ryan has always been sweet and humble caring etc and just \nbecause of that you guys totally hate and loose all respect for ryan? We \nall have those moments, you cant expect him to be perfect'
p1301
aS'was this a depressing video? no did someone die? no were the props the \nsame? no did the props spell the same thing or was even relevant? no \nFINALLY did joule thief see the video? NOPE i do not see how you can judge \nthe two videos... yes they may have the same concept but really now? \n"pretty much the same"? i dont think so!!'
p1302
aS'Amazing! :)'
p1303
aS'smart video'
p1304
aS"See , even if I tried to stop watching your videos...I couldn't! They're \njust so damn addicting to watch! Once you've watched one of your videos, \nyou can't stop watching them. Once a Higaholic , always a Higaholic . <3"
p1305
aS'Ryan ur better than Smosh'
p1306
aS'No one cares, andy rice...'
p1307
aS'I cried!! This is the funniest channel on youtube! Proud to be a subscriber \nof nigahiga!'
p1308
aS'No, thank YOU <3'
p1309
aS'This was just awesome. I remember when Ipod Human was uploaded and everyone \nthought it it was hilarious, oh wait, it still is! :) Great Job Ryan! I \ncant believe its been 6 years! :O'
p1310
aS'Awesome'
p1311
aS'That was awe....AWESOME!!!'
p1312
aS'That was beautiful'
p1313
aS'Aww I almost cried...'
p1314
aS'Fuck you Ryan being butthurt about Joule Thief'
p1315
aS'Which Nigahiga made with them, so it was kind of copying himself'
p1316
aS"Love the idea & video Ryan! But c'mon, Alex didn't knew that u made the \n'exact' thing.. He didn't stole it or anything )="
p1317
aS'Not gonna lie, that was fucking awesome!:D'
p1318
aS'OMG I\'m really how you grown your channel this much I been subscribed to \nyou since "how to be a nerd" and "how to be gangster" I\'m really supporting \nyou all the way an I hope you all the best of luck man. Ohh forgot to ask \ndo you know how to do your hand shake with Sean in how to be gangster'
p1319
aS'Dear keltkilt, why are you being such an a**?'
p1320
aS'Thank you Ryan for proving to your subscribers that you are a real jerk -_-'
p1321
aS"No. If you don't like Ryan's video's and think he's an 'Egotistical \nSelf-centered loser' then don't watch whatever he puts up. Simple. He has \nfans on here and over in this part of youtube, you're going to get a \ngoatload of negativity. We don't look kindly on haters, buddy."
p1322
aS'Better than smosh....just sayin'
p1323
aS'those effects were so cool'
p1324
aS"1) Lay down 2) try not to cry 3) cry alot <3 Ryan i feel like i watched you \ngrow up through all these years :') and im happy others may say i waste my \ntime on youtube but no not at all Ryan we all love you and id liked to say \nthanks :) Less Than Three "
p1325
aS'that was so cool ryan! make another one like it! i like how you made them \nall say teehee at the end. you are so cute ryan higa. keep making videos'
p1326
aS'Fuck you , fucken bitch , why cunt you elimated joule thief'
p1327
aS"I'm sorry Ryan"
p1328
aS"Nothing on YouTube is original anymore! He's only pissed coz Alexs vid was \nSIMILAR to his own. Yet almost everyone else on internet icon copied \nsomething from last season.... Yet I dont see any hate. Be fair or get out, \nbut dont be a hypocrite. Still love Ryan's videos though.."
p1329
aS"He's actually gained subs last time I checked (about 5 minutes ago). So \nwhoever wants to unsub, kudos to you. I'm sticking around however."
p1330
aS"I don't think Alex tried to copy this video and I believe him when he says \nhe hasn't seen it, but I get where Ryan is coming from and in his position \nI think I would have been a little annoyed. I think Alex is awesome, but \nyou can't blame Ryan for him getting eliminated. People need to calm down. "
p1331
aS'I almost cried until tee hee'
p1332
aS"JouleThief's video is so similar to his of course he is going to mention \nit. Ryan even said that he genuinely believes that he didn't steal it, so \nthere were more factors in judging than that. These ignorant people need to \nchill."
p1333
aS'Who left by who would do the best the rest of the competition, obviously \nitd be joule thief not will.'
p1334
aS'Gosh this brought tears to my eyes <3 so many memories!'
p1335
aS"Man, don't be such a crybaby. The guy made a really bad decision and we \nwant him to realize that. That's what the vendetta's for. He's been unfair, \nso yeah, we're being unfair too, because we're mad at him. He never set the \nimage of being an unfair judge until now, so we feel kinda betrayed now. "
p1336
aS'but they wernt lazy. You have to really think and work hard in order to \ncreate something that allows things to get done way faster.'
p1337
aS"Everyone shut the hell up damn. Un-loyal much? How about you think about it \n.. The videos basically are exactly the same. Taking stuff outta the box \nthan it having a memory and than spelling something at the end. And even if \nJoule thief's video wasn't as good as the others. It was good really good. \nBUT other's did better so he was kicked. Stop getting mad over a show like \ndamn. Build a bridge and get over it."
p1338
aS'"wow how dumb are you". This kind of stupidity exists?'
p1339
aS"Sry for all the hate Ryan, you still rock, keep on keepin' on"
p1340
aS'FUCK YOU RYAN'
p1341
aS'ur a cunt...'
p1342
aS'RYAN PLEASE LISTEN! I BEG OF YOU TO DO THIS!!!!!! Make a video of what \nactually went down during the elimination of joule thief, i want people to \nstop hating so you should clear everything up for us. I am actually quite \nsad joule thief left :( . Please thumbs up so ryan can see!!!'
p1343
aS'lol no it didnt /watch?v=6ZzSfZIWgzY august 16 2012. but ik no one copied, \nim just sayin that because he did.'
p1344
aS"Yeah, it happened in march, but we've just seen it now. NOW! "
p1345
aS'so... much... nostalgia... WHY MUST YOU TORTURE ME THIS WAY I STARTED CRYING'
p1346
aS'its incredible .'

aS'\xec\x82\xac\xeb\x9e\x91\xed\x95\x9c\xeb\x8b\xa4 \xec\x9e\x84\xeb\xa7\x88'
p1348
aS'that was kinda the point of the video. i think people noticed..'
p1349
aS'wish he made higa tv by then so i can see the behind the scenes'
p1350
aS'so creative '
p1351
aS'personally, i think this video has more originality to it than JT\'s video. \ni\'ll admit that i agree the fact JT\'s video\'s idea is similar to this one. \nbut it\'s definitely NOT the same. you use flash back scenes, he used black \nand white for "old" memories. you organized prop to make a "thank you" \nusing the shadow, he cut out the prop to make the word (due to time \nconstrain). the idea might be similar, but you cant discredit JT for his \nvideo, considering he only have 6 hours to do so '
p1352
aS"And now he has more than 10.2 million omfg that's so creative your the best \nRyan <<<333"
p1353
aS'you guys should stop hating on Ryan and watch this ----> "Twerking in San \nFrancisco Prank by SimplePickUP" EnJOy!! <3'
p1354
aS'SO CREATIVE'
p1355
aS"The vid seems similar to Joule Theif's so i understand where ryan is \ncomeing from."
p1356
aS'Do you have an instageram ?'
p1357
aS'I wanted to cry but when i see tehee i giggled'
p1358
aS'Ryan didn\'t vote off JouleThief because he "copied" the video as you guys \nare saying. Ryan is just saying that he didn\'t like the video because he \nmade one like it. He is a judge and thats what judges do\xe2\x80\xa6JUDGE the videos \nbased on how much they liked it, and Ryan didn\'t like the video. Geez guys \nstop hating. HATERS GONNA HATE'
p1359
aS'so beautiful!'
p1360
aS"0:58 That's an old banana"
p1361
aS'Wow that thank you was really cool'
p1362
aS'This is amazing :)'
p1363
aS'SO MANY TEEHEEEEEES'
p1364
aS'Aw , that was cool how you put all those videos together and saved those \nprops. It really shows you care... I guess.'
p1365
aS'Dammit it was my borthday on t day'
p1366
aS'LOL the ending ^^'
p1367
aS'Thumbs up if your here from watching Internet icon'
p1368
aS'Guys stop being a banana about what happened with Alex on Internet icon. \nCuz Ryan is a badass!!'
p1369
aS'He got that lamp at Ikea'
p1370
aS'I know I am late writing But thanks for the laughs and how does it feel to \nlook back on all your videos?'
p1371
aS"aww, that's so sweet :) I knew the shadows will say thank you."
p1372
aS'ur wlcome...'
p1373
aS'exactly what i thought! i love ryan, but his logic just makes me confused :/'
p1374
aS'I have a feeling views have spiked on this video within the past 24 hours...'
p1375
aS"wow.. are you even watching internet icon? The next challenge was an \noriginal movie trailer and Joule thief definitely would've won that pay \nattention"
p1376
aS'Awww your welcome....evey thing you used in each video you used to make a \nshodow thank you at 1:46'
p1377
aS"Guys, don't forget that Ryan is not the only one that have negative \njudgement towards Joule thiefs. Think about it before you start hating. "
p1378
aS"It doesn't necessarily have to be a coincidence. I had never seen this \nvideo before Ryan mentioned it on the show, and seeing as how he stated \nthat Joulethief ripped him off, I came to see how similar the videos \nactually were. All I saw was a rather disappointing video that actually \nripped off videos that existed before it. People who are avid subscribers \nof Ryan will stand by him no matter what video puts out, that's just a \nknown fact about fanboys. "
p1379
aS"Ryans videos are so much better now, i dont know what everyone else is \ntalking about. You try and write a video and take that many shots in a week \nand still do other things for other Youtubers. The thing about Joule \nthief's video was his job, ya you may disagree but they were right in their \ndecision because ultimately a lot more people would want to watch Will \nrather than Joule Thief."
p1380
aS'I so saw that comming '
p1381
aS"I don't even remembering him posting this "
p1382
aS"I am a huge Ryan fan, I have been since 2008 when i first made a youtube \nchannel. The only thing is I feel he has not been as funny lately. He's \nbeen getting a little too full of himself and Alex's video was very vaguely \nsimilar to this one; with the objects having a significant meaning and then \nall of them together spelling out a word. Its a common concept and Ryan did \nnot originate it himself, nor did Internet Icon Season 1. Alex for fan \nfavorite!"
p1383
aS'Not even a similar video.'
p1384
aS"This is a good video so don't start hating it people, but I don't see how \nit's at all similar to JouleTheif's other than the spelling words with \nobjects, which many people have done before"
p1385
aS"Just asking, you're so loyal to him because...? "
p1386
aS'Internet icon is fun to watch but too much hating when it started :S'
p1387
aS'Sounds like the right thing to do after how Ryan made his HUGE mistake.'
p1388
aS'dear ryan: rainbow'
p1389
aS'Stop using gay as a derogatory term, this is 2013.. Not 1960. And also; Who \nare you to say someone will never make it? Have you made it? No.'
p1390
aS'...why are you telling Ryan what he did in his video? '
p1391
aS'thats what i am trying to explain to everyone'
p1392
aS'Joulethief didnt copy you, he shouldve won!!'
p1393
aS'but he poorly judged him, did you watch the episode? they spoke about who \nhad a bigger fan base and thats how they would base their judging off of as \nwell as other factors joule their had a huge fan base as you can see and \nhis video was not bad. were not unloyal.'
p1394
aS"More like his ego got too big and people are just getting tired of him. Im \nnot gonna lie either, Ryan hasn't been putting up really good videos, so \nfar they are meh. He used to be funnier back then..."
p1395
aS"I'd like to know that"
p1396
aS"Crying soooo hard right now :') Looovvvee you ryan higa"
p1397
aS'Thats really creative'
p1398
aS'Awesome Video!'
p1399
aS'Yeah..... 10 MILLION subs... Holy @!&%'
p1400
aS'teehee'
p1401
aS"Achda u need to learn manners. Just from this u can't tell if \nhe's...different! Think before u comment"

aS'he did all thosy vedos'
p1404
aS'Apply cold water to the burned area '
p1405
aS'AMAZING omg!!!!!'
p1406
aS'Joule Thief made a video like this...'
p1407
aS"Joule Thief is a good competitior... but he didn't leave because their \nvideos were similar. There's alot of talent in this season and his video \njust didn't make the cut. There's more than one judge, so it's not all \nRyan's fault. Chill out."
p1408
aS'Teehee'
p1409
aS'OH, it it was so beautiful'
p1410
aS'I love you Ryan! So much creativity and cuteness all in one person!'
p1411
aS"Just wanted to say... Alex didn't see your video. Why were you still so \nupset about it? It's not like the idea is unique, really. It's a kind of \nsimple concept and he just so happened to do something similar. Judge him \nbased on the video he submitted, hes past videos and him as a YouTuber, not \na completely wrong statement you made. Thank you."
p1412
aS'i loved the thank u part and i subscribed TEEHEE'
p1413
aS'Hes so awesome 3'
p1414
aS"Do not forget that we've only seen Ryan doing that in Internet icon for \nlike what.. just two or three days ago? So I'd say that both of us are too \nquick to judge whether the anger will die out when right now the anger is \nstill fresh and new... people could say just about anything with their \nnewborn emotions. But if you know how enough how good Ryan is then believe \nme that it will because clearly you're not the only one who could see it . \n. ."
p1415
aS'lol thats so creative'
p1416
aS'Thank you too ryqn you supplied sooo many hours of enter tainment for me!!!'
p1417
aS"Nice video You're welcome Ryan and keep up the good work. :)"
p1418
aS'arent enough ppl to subscribe '
p1419
aS"You copied JouleThief's video. "
p1420
aS'Joule thief is already gone, get over it.'
p1421
aS"This is nothing like Joule Thief's video. You shouldn't eliminate him just \ncuz his video is similar to yours"
p1422
aS"Or maybe the people who commented earlier really did like the video, and \nthe people who are commenting now don't. How about that? "
p1423
aS'@JouleThiefs was definitely better and he had to do it in 6 hours'
p1424
aS"Why are you people hating on Ryan? They didn't eliminate Joule Thief \nbecause he had a similar idea to Ryan. It was because his video wasn't as \nsad as they judges would like it to be."
p1425
aS'THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HATING ON YOU. Make your next vid. Vlog to tell people \nyour side of the issue. Anyway im still a big fan!'
p1426
aS'Dear ryan-there is probably a very low chance that you will read this but \neveryone is complaining that you suck at judging. I understand it was a \nhard decision to make but maybe MAKE LIKE a VLOG FOR YOUR NEXT VID TALKING \nTO'
p1427
aS"Joule Thief's video was very different from yours Ryan, the only thing that \nreminds a bit is the word thing with the props, but I don't think anyone \nwould remember your 6 million subscribers thank video so... Not saying \nAlex's video was the best on the episode, but your argument for not liking \nit was not nice."
p1428
aS"Well, I definitely am. He acted like a little baby and definitely wasn't \nthat humble/shy/whater on the show, am I right?"
p1429
aS'No offence But I could not even remember THIS video and I have watched all \nof yours so I do not see how Alex was supposed to :('
p1430
aS"The videos are pretty similar. And he didn't blame JouleThief for that \neither. JouleThief was eliminated because his video was 'OK' as a sad video."
p1431
aS"I love Ryan but um... you didn't invent the whole concept of looking \nthrough a box of memories and spelling a word out with props. Plus, the \nvideos really aren't that similar IMO"
p1432
aS'like this comment because im socially awkward... it will make me feel \nbetter... so please.like the comment above me. \\ '
p1433
aS'I remember when I commented on this video:"Aww :)",now I can\'t find my \ncomment.But, now I would comment:"Why Ryan O_O",but still it\'s an "Aww :)"'
p1434
aS'internet icon bring me here'
p1435
aS"It's funny how your comment and the other top comment are contradictory"
p1436
aS"Wow Ryan I'm disappointed with your attitude as a judge, I thought you're \nbetter than that </3"
p1437
aS"Yes true, I would rather find JouleTheif more worth watching because he's a \nnew youtuber that will eventually become known, and Ryan... well he's \ngetting a little old."
p1438
aS"Aww. I teared up at the end when it formed a thank you. Awwwww. i cried. :')"
p1439
aS'awesome '
p1440
aS'um he just plays games like a person that doesnt have a life and ryan \nactuly takes days to make 1 video for pewdiepie it only takes how ever long \nhis vids are and doesnt take days to make 1 vid '

p1450
aS'This video made me emotional'
p1451
aS"I don't remb Ryan saying anything like 'you copied my video!!!', he just \nsaid it's similar to his video which is true. It's not Ryan that's \nbutthhurt but you people just bc your fav contestant got kicked out."
p1452
aS'Been here since the first :)) I feel so loved'
p1453
aS'Ryan, really expected more from you, you were the reason i started watching \nyoutube videos, cos i thought you were a good guy, now you are just turning \nto be a douche with a big ego. '

aS'*were '
p1464
aS'So many teehees...'
p1465
aS"Wow you're annoying. I got those numbers from going on his channel and \nwatching videos cuz i like his videos. When i went on after the JT drama \nvideo to find this particular video it was much lower. If someone made a \nvideo similar to mine i would be glad because it was SIMILAR not the same, \ntherefore i had a part in influencing them. Ryan does have significant pull \nin the judges votes to sway them, thats just how people are. Plus, i wasnt \neven talking to you dude. CHILL OUT"
p1466
aS"Fuck you bitch, how is this shit similar to Alex's video. "
p1467
aS"Can you guys shut up Ryan wasn't trying to say he copied him, he was just \ntrying to say that other people have done the same idea so it isn't that \noriginal which they are looking for, in this part of the competition."
p1468
aS"to all the people who are hating on ryan; it's human nature to feel anger \nwhen someone copies you especially if it's an idea you thought was \noriginally yours. He made a mistake, but don't we all? Secondly and this is \nmy personal opinion, but Joule Thief's video wasn't AS sad/beautiful in \ncomparison to the other videos which were very funny/entertaining. I \nrespect his decision to make a heartfelt and more serious video, but he \ndidn't quite pull it off. It was a mess-up in terms of strategy. "
p1469
aS"he should have been a better sport about it. in any normal situation its \nacceptable but when competing for 10,000 dollars you can't do that. he was \na dick in that episode. i'm not saying i hate him but he should not have \ndone that in a competition i honestly love his vids"
p1470
aS"I don't think JouleTheif copied, but you gotta admit it similar in terms of \nthe major features"
p1471
aS'What makes you think that? Who did make it then, you just can assume that. '
p1472
aS'What season 1 Internet Icon video? Can you name is specifically please? Amd \ndont cuss and reply to me, cussing is not what I am about you Joule Thief \nfan girl'
p1473
aS'FUCK YOU RYAN!!!'
p1474
aS"Okay just wanna say RYAN IS THS JUDGE ON INTERNET ICON NOT YOU!! If he \nthinks that there videos are similar that's his a opinion an if your \nopinion is that they aren't the same is your opinion an you don't have to \ncall him names or be rude about it! It is what it is calling mean names \nisn't going to change what happened its over! So cry a river build a bridge \nan get over it"
p1475
aS"It's Joule DUMBASS!"
p1476
aS'ryan copies a video that he was in and has seen entirely. Joule thief makes \none and ryan acts like he must have seen it and be copying.'
p1477
aS'I doubt Ryan was the first person ever to use this concept (using a box \nfull of items and flashing back with a concluding message)'
p1478
aS'probably ryan idea tho'
p1479
aS'Internet Icon, anyone??'
p1480
aS"see the internet icon season 1 video, is the same idea and Ryan copied it. \nYou can't copy this idea from Ryan because he did not fucking invented it."
p1481
aS'And it wasnt even a mistake'
p1482
aS'Jewel thief did watch this i think'
p1483
aS"People really got to stop hating on Ryan, like seriously. Can't you guys \njust forget about it? He's a judge, he's suppose to give his most honest \nopinion on Internet Icon. I thought Joule Thief's video did kind of copied \nRyan's. that's just MY opinion."
p1484
aS'which is funny because this video is almost an exact copy of a video on \ninternet icon season 1 final\xc3\xa9 -.- '
p1485
aS'Wow, so many butthurts'
p1486
aS"'I honestly don't care', he said. 'I've already done the same thing', he \nsaid..."

aS'Aww this is cute c:'
p1489
aS'Made me cry'
p1490
aS'comedy....sarcasm...irony....you ever heard of it??'
p1491
aS'I just laughed so hard at the "TEEHEE" part xDD'
p1492
aS"On Internet icon episode 7 featuring ijustine Ryan higa said that joule \ntheif's video was exactly the same as this one Ryan was completly wrong \naside from the ending nothing was the same at lest we knew that joule \ntheif's video was suppose to be sad with this video I might just be me but \nI don't find it to be sad or funny Ryan said his video took longer to make \nthan joule's video which is really sad considering you're one of the \nbiggest youtubers (unsubscribe)"
p1493
aS'...upset...'
p1494
aS'& a world of nigahiga vids'
p1495
aS":')so beautiful"
p1496
aS'That was sooo touching and creative. Ryan Higa I LOVE YOU!!! and you make \nmy day :D <3'
p1497
aS"It's not even similar to joulethief's video. Here you're remembering your \nown damn self, his video was about remembering someone who is not near him \nany more. He didn't copy this video"
p1498
aS"That's amazing!"
p1499
aS" Just because it was similar to YOUR video Ryan, you personally didn't like \nit? What?! Come on dude, the audience loved it! :-/"
p1500
aS'That was beautiful :")'
p1501
aS'Another thank you video for reaching 10 million??? Congrats Ryan less than \nthree!!!!'

aS'Help him reach 10000000 people'
p1507
aS'I started crying when you brought out the ninja stars.... I love you Ryan! \n(:'
p1508
aS'That is awesome'
p1509
aS"Ryan was NOT the only judge and Joule Thief was NOT eliminated soley based \nupon the fact that there were similarities between the two videos. There \nwere three other judges on that panel and none of them seemed to be \nthrilled with the route Joule Thief chose to go: a sad video. They \nrepeatedly said that when they go onto youtube, they don't want to be sad. \nThey also chose Will because they've seen him grow so much on the show. \nRe-watch the deliberation and elimination if you have to."
p1510
aS'Awww that was cute! Your welcome!'
p1511
aS'Awesome.. Very nice'
p1512
aS"You Don't Say (\xe2\x95\xaf\xc2\xb0\xe2\x96\xa1\xc2\xb0\xef\xbc\x89\xe2\x95\xaf\xef\xb8\xb5 \xe2\x94\xbb\xe2\x94\x81\xe2\x94\xbb"
p1513
aS"I think that a person's portrayal in their videos is somewhat a projected \nversion of their personality. But the truth is, we don't know any of these \npeople personally. I even met Ryan once and he was super nice and down to \nearth, but at the end of the day, we, his fans, have no idea who he is, so \nwe shouldn't judge him. Internet Icon seems very fake to me, so i dont \nthink we know what really happened. I'm a fan of both Ryan and JouleThief, \nthough"
p1514
aS'Ryan please return to your old self the one the made how to be ninja \ngangster all that good stuff'
p1515
aS'I came here from the internet icon video where you mentioned alex making a \nvideo like this one while they are similar in some ways yes, kind of \negotistical to think he must have seen it if not just a little asshole-ish \nto not like a video because the two a similar in style but different in \nmeaning.'
p1516
aS'and your just a bitch'
p1517
aS"if I was Ryan, I would be a little mad. but I enjoyed both videos for their \nown causes. I'm upset that Alex was eliminated. but when lie"
p1518
aS"i liked Joule Thief's video better"
p1519
aS'Wow you seem like a witty, and an intelligent person. You sure showed all \nthose people who criticized Ryan.'
p1520
aS'Honestly nothing compared to joule thiefs video'
p1521
aS"That wasn't even that similar "
p1522
aS"How would i know if i liked it if i didn't watch it?"
p1523
aS"Great video, but its really not that similar to Joule thief's ..."
p1524
aS"i love alex. i love ryan. i loved alex's video. i love this one more."
p1525
aS"and the only reason why people watch internet icon is because of ryan. I \nwon't be surprised to see the number of viewers decrease."
p1526
aS'bitch '
p1527
aS'Lmfao. You think Ryan will applaud your ignorance. Good luck, schmuck.'
p1528
aS"Ryan said it was the exact same thing... I don't see it as the exact same \nthing, but the props at the end are SIMILAR! Total difference."
p1529
aS"I didn't know that only Ryan was aloud to make videos like this.."
p1530
aS'did any of you ever have to be a judge like ryan? why do you think all the \njudges keep saying "oh man this is hard!" because it is incredibly tough! \nhow would you have reacted if you had to judge a video that you already did \nin a very similar way and that even ends the exact same way? do you really \nthink you would just sit there and say nothing about it? of course not, the \nfirst question would be: hey dude did you copy my video??? ryan had to \nbring that up and he was rather polite about it.'
p1531
aS'And joule theirs'
p1532
aS'Ryan... Come on man, it just felt like a bully talking down a small kid in \nthe playground on the Internet Icon. I hate that so much. The way you \ntalked to Joule Thief was so uncalled for. It would have been better if \nyou\'d just said, "I didn\'t like it" and that\'s it. When Timothy said, "I \nchose who I think will do better" I thought Alex was safe but everyone had \nto kiss up to the big guy to get in good with him. Good job, Ryan. You\'ll \nprobably kick the Kloons next for all I know...'
p1533
aS'I love your videos and i always have but, we all know know Alex did not \nintend to make that video, that was pretty cruel what you did, but i know \nyou are probably getting a lot of hate comments so sorry about that. '
p1534
aS'u know he wasnt the only one who voted him off'
p1535
aS'And joule thieves'
p1536
aS"i didn't even see this till I watched internet icons new episode poor alex"
p1537
aS"but he worked really hard and higa hated hte video simply because some one \ncopied him when he wasn't the only one to every make a video like this so \nyeah im not unsubing but higa will always seem to be a little of an ass \nfrom now on"
p1538
aS"to the people that said im unsubscribing to you i bet you guys weren't even \nfans at all BITCHES!!!!!"
p1539
aS'Joule theifs video brought me here'
p1540
aS"It sucks to see Joule Thief leave, but don't hate on Ryan or the other \ncontestants. Just subscribe to Joule Thief and vote for him as fan \nfavorite. "
p1541
aS':( joulethief'
p1542
aS"Don't hate on this video guys, it was all of the judges' faults that alex \ngot eliminated"
p1543
aS"Best thank you video ever oAo...This should be the most viewed video \n>w>//..It's so creative "
p1544
aS'Rewatching*'
p1545
aS'i think i have seen this done before'
p1546
aS'I LOVE YOU RYAN!!!!!'
p1547
aS'Nice'
p1548
aS'Stop hating on home this video is like exactly the same what joule thief \ndid but it is not romance it is thanks if you hate you hate but there is \nmore than 1 judge and maybe joule thief was lying cause in my eyes I see a \nvideo that has the same concept but in a different way'
p1549
aS"He probably influenced the other judges' decision (if it we're not \nscripted), because ijustine said that JouleThief's video was really good at \nfirst. They probably all just jumped into ryan's bandwagon of bullshittery."
p1550
aS'1:52TETETETEEEETETETETETEHETEHTHEEEEHEHHEEEEEEETETHEEEEEEEETEEHEE!'
p1551
aS'We love you Ryan! <3'

p1558
aS'No....thank you'
p1559
aS'Ryan thank you for making your videos in the first place and i will remain \nhappily subscribed to you. Your awesome'
p1560
aS'I watched you since the how to be ninja vid came out'
p1561
aS'Fck you ryan for kicking out joule thief.'
p1562
aS"Guys! Please don't unsubscribe! He's not jealous...it was just almost the \nexact same thing. I didn't realize it until now that it was the exact same \nthing... Please don't unsubscribe!"
p1563
aS"I loved both videos. I love Ryan he's amazing and has been since the \nbeginning I just don't like how he judged on Internet icon cause I love \nAlex and I watched like all his videos twice"
p1564
aS'hoe'
p1565
aS"After watching this video I think it's not that Ryan hate the same video \nfrom Joule. But an emotional video like this is depends on originality more \nthan gag video to get people feel in touch with it. And Joule won't make \nthat video if he ever watched this. IT'S EVEN THE SAME GREEN BALL! bad part \nis he never watch this and the result is that he got eliminated."
p1566
aS'Poor Alex. :c'
p1567
aS'the idea was copied but its 2 completely different stories '
p1568
aS'pipe the fuck up* "and internet icon needs a winner who is a vlogger??" did \nyou pull that out of your ass?'
p1569
aS'Trust me, we all were crushed about Justin, but he lost because of the \nrules of the show. Joule Thief lost because Ryan thinks his video wasn\'t \n"sad enough" but it was trying to "make you cry" at the same time. (Make up \nyour mind judges) We blame Ryan because we\'re the internet, that\'s what we \ndo. Blame the one with the biggest voice. And that just happened to be Ryan \ntoday.'
p1570
aS'Omg.. '
p1571
aS"This isn't at all near joule thief's video. And Alex went in a different \ndirection than everyone else, which you have to respect. When it comes down \nto Will of Joule Thief, I would and have subscribed to joule thief but \nwould never subscribe to Will since all of his videos are the same"
p1572
aS"Laughing at everyone hating on Ryan because of Internet Icon... You're \ngiving him more views so I don't think he cares what anyone says, that's \nwhat he's supposed to do he's a judge. but then again everyone is entitled \nto their own opinion. oh well."
p1573
aS'I feel sorry for Ryan that he has to deal with all this crap. Good Luck man.'
p1574
aS"Everyone who is unsubscribing, think if it like this, when Justin James \nHughes got kicked off Internet Icon I was crushed but I am actually \nsubscribed to him and not the brothers riddle (the winners of last year) \nthis elimination is a blessing in disguise. Don't blame Ryan for this I \nwould be pretty upset too if someone did almost the exact same visor than \nmine. He's not jealous just concerned about the rules and guide lines of \nthe competition. Please don't unsubscribe it's not worth it."
p1575
aS'I will always love Ryan but i wish Joule Theif didnt get out he was AMAZINg '

aS"This is the most heart warming video like ever :')"
p1601
aS"He was rude and unfair... and internet icon doesn't revolve around ryan, I \nstill would've seen JouleThief's vid.... ryan made youtube better, but he \nisn't the only one that can make a good video"
p1602
aS'... Wow Ryan'
p1603
aS"Cant you guys get over this? You guys said stupid things just because of \none video and you guys just forget all the things that he did.He's a \nperson,he could be cocky or even mean, selfish sometimes. That's what about \nbeing a famous person, you just gotta be perfect or else you'll get fucking \nhate. You guys are just that kind of people who love drama and making a big \ndeal out of nothing"
p1604
aS'your welcom teehee'
p1605
aS"This is actually the first time I've seen this video.. And Joule Thief's \nvideo is nothing like this one, this is a thank you video. Joule Thief's \nhad a story. Oh well, it is what it is."
p1606
aS'Someone has a brain.. '
p1607
aS'dude u forgot the teehee at the end'
p1608
aS'I thought joule thief should have beat will at least..'
p1609
aS"You don't own this concept/format Joule thief made a good video and it \nwasn't that similar you were just complaining on how it was almost the \nsame. Joule thief made an amazing video and he should've won so f you Ryan. \nIn subscribing"
p1610
aS'The videos are actually pretty similiar.so,stfu.'
p1611
aS'most of us love ryan like me but hate that he got out... '

aS'Will is gonna leave next week anyways.. Alex clearly beat him. '
p1614
aS'Wow just ............. Ugh ...... Dont know what to think if i should agree \nw/ you or disagree but if they hade as much time as they wanted i feel like \nalexs would be better ! Just saying but why do have to be the simon judge'
p1615
aS'cause of Internet Icon'
p1616
aS'I wanna rage so bad, I guarantee someone has done this before you man but \nwhatever, it just kinda sucks'
p1617
aS"Joule Theif's video was better."
p1618
aS'Wow.. so many haters'
p1619
aS'Im sorry but I disliked this video. If anything, Ryan should have commended \nJoule Theif for using the same format.'
p1620
aS'yes'
p1621
aS"Aw that's nice"
p1622
aS"Everyone shut up, we all love Ryan, we all love Alex. At the end of the day \nthey're both amazing youtubers we should just respect. Ryan is a judge, and \nwell he judged he did his part and Alex (Joule Theif) did his part in the \nshow but just wasnt up to part."
p1623
aS'haha i was gonna say that'
p1624
aS'Stop hating Ryan for joule thief!'
p1625
aS'fuck'
p1626
aS'ryan this is what you call similar, the story (if you paid any attention) \nare completely different -_- sigh, bit big head to think that his seen your \nvid '
p1627
aS"Alex didn't rip Ryan off, he didn't even know about this video."
p1628
aS'Wow so many people on here talking about joule thief...'
p1629
aS"All of you guys get over yourselves. This is the judges decision being butt \nhurt isn't going to affect it. The reason Alex went home wasn't because of \nthe similarities if you guys actually paid attention ryan said he doesn't \nbelieve Alex copied his video. Leave him alone, hes a judge and he has to \nbe harsh. Just vote for Alex for fan favorite. "
p1630
aS"All of you guys are dumbasses. All of the judges agreed that JouleThief's \nvideo wasn't that great, not just Ryan."
p1631
aS'like if u have seen them all n loved this video '
p1632
aS"Guys stop hating Ryan. He's not the only one who decided to eliminate Joule \nThief. Their videos are similar, but not EXACTLY the same like Ryan said. \nThat's the only thing that annoyed me. But it wasn't just Ryan who disliked \nhis video. But I'm still kinda disappointed that Joule Thief is gone. I \nloved him. And he would probably win the next challenge.... :("
p1633
aS"While your video is purely based on Spelling, with a few flash backs, \nAlex's video actually was more about the story behind it, the actual \nspelling seemed like a last minute deal while your video is all about the \nspelling. Ryan is just mad someone can be up to par with him with little \nsubs."
p1634
aS'very original :|'
p1635
aS'One: He never overreacted and Two: He never said anything about Alex \nhurting his ego. Everyone is just freaking out a BIT too much.'

p1792

p1793
aS'Nice'
p1794
aS'Awesome!'
p1795
aS"they didn't eliminate joule thief on the basis of the copying thing, they \neliminated him because his video wasn't as good as others which I agreed \npersonally and if you really feel sad for him then just subscribe to his \nchannel."

p1826
aS'STOP HATING ON RYAN BECAUSE OF HIS VERY FAIR JUDGING'
p1827
aS'So Ryan I felt your judging was a little stupid ...... That is all. \nactually really stupid'
p1828
aS'\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4\xe2\x9d\xa4'
p1829
aS"Who else felt that heavy heart beat..? I can't believe i've been watching \nyour videos this long? You are my internet inspiration "
p1830
aS'Awww, this is just so sweet. Had a very nostalgic and sentimental feel to \nit :3'
p1831
aS"You guys are idiots if you are mad over the fact that Ryan had to let go of \nJouleThief because he stole his idea. Guys, someone had to go and that's \nthe bad part about being a judge. You have to let someone go and i am \npretty sure if he had said no to someone else, you guys would have been \nmad. Ryan is a great person and don't get mad because he let someone down. \nI liked JouleThief's video, i admit it. I also like Ryan's video. They were \nboth great. Quit with all this argument and behave. "
p1832
aS"Amazing video :) And you're welcome!"
p1833
aS'Nice don'
p1834
aS'I love it... Amazing Ryan... <3'

aS'Your Welcome and Thank you........Teehee'
p1838
aS"That's the greatest way of saying thank you Ryan even though I just \nsubscribed yesterday XD"
p1839
aS'Wait... he left the banana in a box?'
p1840
aS'EXACTLY, thats why the top 100 is there, Smosh, Ryan, AND Pewds was #1 at \nsome point. pewds is just the current youtuber'
p1841
aS'funny thing is that i actually thought about the same video! the only \ndifference is that i actually have a conscience to tell me not to mention \nit over and over again! btw assuming someone copied your video before \nasking them if they saw it is not judging! its called giving false facts'
p1842
aS"I can see how his video is similar, he is pulling out props out of a box \nand it's playing back memories of the specific item, then both have the \nsame ending. Either way, Ryans video is better than Joules."
p1843
aS'<3'
p1844
aS"Teehee's at the end hilarious"

aS"Best thank you video I've ever seen."
p1877
aS'Brings tears to my eyes every time.'
p1878
aS"alright calm down joule thief's was similar to ryan's, and you'd be an \nidiot not to accept that. That being said, ryan wasn't accusing joule thief \nof copying him, but more so just stating that he didn't find it as \nimpressive of a video because it wasn't super original as ryan himself made \none like it. Also, joule thief's video wasn't bad, but all the other \ncontestants had great videos too and one had to go. And there's nothing you \ncan do about it, so calm yourself."
p1879
aS"What the hell the story is totally different in Alex's video !!!!! He's not \nsaying thank you :( and it's just the ending that's similar :(:("
p1880
aS"It weren't just a few sentences. He accused Joule Thief twice for copying \nhis video, which he clearly didn't. Ofcourse people are going to get mad. \nAnd by the way, Joule Thief was a great contestant."
p1881
aS'Goosebumps :) in a good way :D'
p1882
aS"Guys you can't compare pewdipie and Ryan cus 1 is a gamer and 1 just dies \ncomedy vids"
p1883
aS"Nope ^_^ But even if it's rude as heck I don't like haters who try to \ninfluence others because of a few sentences."
p1884
aS'No problem :)'
p1885
aS"Stop hating on pewdiepie. They're both a different type of youtuber. That \ndoesn't mean one isn't as good as the other.They both make me laugh."
p1886
aS"Mad 'cause joules thief had a better video... "
p1887
aS'Watched it twice. Brilliant!! :-) awesomeeee'

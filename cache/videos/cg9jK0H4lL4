So \nfast forward 40 years or so, you got idiots like lil wayne, drake, iggy \nazelia, etc. rap was supposed to be basically ghetto poetry. \nhttp://genius.com/Nas-the-world-is-yours-lyrics\xef\xbb\xbf"

Rihanna) \n\nLazy Rapping - "Started from the bottom now we\'re here, started from the \nbottom now the whole team\'s here" (Started from the bottom: Drake (Hes \nRight!)\n\nDruggy Rapping - "La-da-da-da-dahhhhh" (Dr.Dre - The Next Episode ft Snoop \nDogg, Nate Dogg)\n\nAngry Rapping - "I GOT A LAPTOP IN BACK POCKET" (Rap god - Eminem (Hes \nRight Again!)\n \nQuiet Mumble Rapping "If I was your boyfriend I\'d never let you go" \n(Boyfriend - Justin Bieber (use his example :P)\n\nToo fast to understand Rapping "I \naisfdbiasdnflsdnfijlnglkjdfngkljdnfaglkjnsdlfgjkndfg" (Rap god - Eminem)\n\nfor those who disagree, this is just my opinion of what was made out of my \nboredom.

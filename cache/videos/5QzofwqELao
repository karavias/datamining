p23
aS'Here\'s my theory of this music video: when Ryan said "why? So you can buy \nmore drugs?" It means Ryan took the drugs which caused him to get high and \nsing about coffee and throw coffee everywhere. This means, how did Ryan \nknow that josh was taking the drugs? I think Ryan took it and did drugs \nlike what I said before. So he probably replaced the drugs with coffee \nbeans at the beginning of the video. Once again, it\'s a theory.\xef\xbb\xbf'

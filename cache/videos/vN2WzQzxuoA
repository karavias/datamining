S"*We've got **a lot** to be thankful for*\n\nAlways good to be reminded that most of our problems are First World \nProblems.\n\nIf you use words like *'upgrades', 'leftovers', choices'* pertaining to \nyour life, you are rich compared to the majority of the world's population \n- those who don't know the meaning of those words.\n\nHere's another eye-opener: *making $18,000 a year puts you in the top 4.85% \nof the world' population.* (http://www.globalrichlist.com/) Top 5%!!! \n\nYes, we have everything to be thankful for.\n\n#thanksgiving2014   #bethankful   #happythanksgiving  \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'I\'m a bit confused about the metaphors. Is the straw to metaphorically suck \nup the contents of the metaphorically full cup and is the lid to stop your \nmetaphoric cup running over or to stop it getting half empty? Why would you \nwant to stop your cup running over anyway if we are talking metaphors for \nhow fortunate we are in the first world and how we should be seeing the \npositive "cup half full" view point? Does the metaphoric bridge refer \nto having better understanding of the deprivations of those living in the \nless developed world? If so it is not very clear to me and the actors \ndelivering the advice display a very aggressive, holier-than-thou, manner. \nI think it is arrogant to judge people because their problems seem trivial \nwhen compared to those of less fortunate people - we are all souls on a \njourney, learning from our experiences, though our material circumstances \nmay be very different. One should show compassion for someone\'s pain - \nhowever trivial their problem may seem to you. Through empathy, you can \nhelp someone gain insight, grow emotionally and spiritually, learn to see \ntheir problems in perspective and think what they can do to help others, \nbut there is no need to try to correct them aggressively or by loading them \nwith guilt. My feeling is that this advertisement seems to be more in the \nnature of a bit of spin to excuse some (presumed) technological flaws in \nthe iphone 6 rather than saying anything really pertinent about the human \ncondition.\xef\xbb\xbf'

aS'Stop Complaining\n\n\nStop complaining\nStop complaining.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re anything like me, there are probably certain traits that you see \nin other people that drive you crazy.\nFor example, here are a few less-than-pleasant traits that most \nwell-adjusted people can\xe2\x80\x99t stand: rudeness, selfishness, thoughtlessness, \nlaziness, arrogance, intolerance, dishonesty, and apathy, just to name a \nfew.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one more trait that\xe2\x80\x99s not on the list above that truly drives \nme insane.\nI think that the reason why it annoys the hell out of me so much is because \nI used to be the living, breathing poster child for this miserable trait on \na daily basis.\nI was a chronic complainer. Yup, yours truly.\nThere used to be a time in the not-so-distant past where I would complain \nabout anything and everything to anyone who had the misfortune of being \nstuck listening to my constant whining.\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it was about my job, the weather, the pain in my knee, \nmy sorry bank account, my girlfriend drama, how busy I was, how tired I was \n(you get the picture). If something ever went wrong in my life, please \ntrust that I would instantly put a negative spin on it, and then spend the \nrest of the day (or longer) complaining about it.\nTo this day, I am so thankful that I had a mentor years ago who was willing \nto snap me out of my funk by giving me some much-needed tough love.\nHe told me that my personal relationships would eventually suffer if I \ncontinued to constantly suck the energy out of every room with my \ncomplaining (he was right).\nHe told me that my professional career would eventually stall out if I \nconstantly repelled the people who I worked with by complaining instead of \ntaking action (again, he was right).\nHe told me that my mental, emotional, and even physical health would \neventually decline if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a decision to stop complaining and \nwallowing in negativity everyday (he was still right).\nIt was then that he challenged me to do something that I thought would be \ncompletely impossible. More about that challenge is coming up later on in \nthis post.\nThankfully, I accepted his challenge, because doing so completely \ntransformed my life. More accurately, it saved my life.\nI have never looked at complaining in the same way ever since, and if you \nengage in chronic complaining like I did, then hopefully I can help you to \nbreak the cycle too.\nAll it takes is a little tough love. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\nVenting vs. Complaining\nQuite a few people often get confused by the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cventing\xe2\x80\x9d \nand \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining,\xe2\x80\x9d so let me set the record straight.\nVenting is a good thing.\nVenting is simply about blowing off some steam for one reason or another. \nFor example, you might need to vent after you get off the phone with a \nridiculously rude customer, or after a bird took a poop on your brand new \njacket as you were walking into the office.\nVenting is a positive and healthy activity because there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear goal \ninvolved: you are expelling your negative feelings (anger, frustration, \netc.) about the situation and once you\xe2\x80\x99re done, you let it go.\nDone correctly, venting should be an intentional and temporary state. \nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about wallowing in the situation for weeks, days, or even \nhours\xe2\x80\x93you vent about the asshat customer or the asshat bird (side note: can \na bird be an asshat?), and then once it\xe2\x80\x99s off your chest, you move on.\nA good way to know that you\xe2\x80\x99re venting and not complaining is that you \nshould feel much better once you\xe2\x80\x99re done.\nComplaining, on the other hand, may look similar to venting, but they are \nreally nothing alike.\nThere is no clear goal to complaining. In fact, more often than not, \ncomplainers aren\xe2\x80\x99t even interested in finding a solution to what they\xe2\x80\x99re \nwhining about.\nEven worse, whereas venting can be done alone (for example, going to the \ngym for a hard workout, writing an emotional letter then throwing it away, \nor even crying can all be considered as venting), complaining is all about \nchoosing to stay in a negative state by projecting that negativity onto \nsomeone else.\nComplaining, unlike venting, isn\xe2\x80\x99t a temporary state of blowing off steam.\nComplainers are usually stuck in a destructive pattern of needing a captive \naudience to serve as a dumping ground for their negative emotions.\nPut it this way\xe2\x80\x93you\xe2\x80\x99ll know that you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a chronic complainer \nif you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid to strike up conversation with him/her by asking the \nnormally innocent question: \xe2\x80\x9chey, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going?\xe2\x80\x9d\nComplainers will bitch and moan (without listening to a word that you have \nto say), and of course, they\xe2\x80\x99ll happily take up as much of your time as \nyou\xe2\x80\x99re willing to give to them. Worst of all, if you allow them to, they\xe2\x80\x99ll \nend up dragging you down into their emotional cesspool with you.\nAlso unlike venting, most complainers don\xe2\x80\x99t feel better after a marathon \ncomplaining session\xe2\x80\x93if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, just ask them. You won\xe2\x80\x99t feel \nbetter either if you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck listening to it.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing healthy about complaining. And just like many other \nunhealthy pursuits, it can be addicting if you choose to partake in this \nactivity too often.\nAs a former addict, let me share how I kicked the habit, cold turkey.\nThe Challenge That Broke The Addiction\nThe worst part of complaining is that most chronic complainers think that \nthey\xe2\x80\x99re just venting\xe2\x80\x93I know this because I was one of those people who \nsuffered from that common delusion.\nThe truth was that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t venting, because it was far from a temporary, \nonce-in-a-while type of deal for me. I was stuck in a constant state of \nnegativity, whining, and complaining.\nAs soon as something went wrong in my life, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even entertain the \nidea that there could be a nugget of positivity hidden inside of the \ndifficult situation. Instead, my brain was destructively programmed to be \ncued up with a ready-made complaint to dump on any sucker who was willing \nto listen. There was nothing productive about my behavior\xe2\x80\x93I just whined and \nhoped that people would feel sorry for me and how \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d my life was.\nLooking back on it now, I can only imagine how challenging it must have \nbeen to live with me, work with me, or hang out with me.\nI was unquestionably addicted to complaining.\nThankfully, one of my mentors who was clearly sick and tired of my constant \nwhining and challenged me to do something that was unthinkable to me at the \ntime.\nHe challenged me to go 24-hours without complaining about anything.\nAt first I was a little annoyed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a complainer! I should be allowed to vent when I\xe2\x80\x99m frustrated!\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it and told me to humor him and try it\xe2\x80\x93so I did. The next 24 \nhours changed my life forever.\nFor the first time, I learned what it meant to truly live from conscious \nintention instead of unconsciously from habit.\nWhenever something happened to me that day that was less than ideal, I \npaused to notice the automatic complaint that was about to leave my \nmouth\xe2\x80\x93and then something very simple, but incredibly powerful happened next.\nI chose to think a different thought, and equally as important, I chose to \nsay more empowering words instead.\nIt sounds so simple, but I realized on that day for the first time in my \nlife that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be negative when faced with less than ideal \ncircumstances.\nThe choice was always mine, but as crazy as this may sound to some people \nreading this, I never realized it until I completed the 24-hour challenge. \nI thought that complaining is something that you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9csupposed\xe2\x80\x9d to do when \nshitty things happen.\nI was so wrong.\nI could choose to reject negativity and be positive instead.\nBeing positive has consistently gotten such a bad rap in some circles, and \nit\xe2\x80\x99s time for it stop. Positivity has nothing to do with refusing to see \nnegative events, or even worse, sticking our head in the sand and \npretending that the negative event is not happening to us.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not positivity, that\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity.\nPositivity is about refusing to dwell in negativity, and more importantly, \nit\xe2\x80\x99s about consciously choosing to focus on more productive and useful \nsolutions instead.\nOr said differently, positivity is all about acknowledging the negativity, \nbut never choosing to live there.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between venting and complaining, and this simple wisdom \nsaved my relationships, saved my career, and without any doubt, saved me \nfrom a living a life that would be far from my best life.\nTo me, choosing to break the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplaining addiction\xe2\x80\x9d is the only option \nthat makes any sense.\nFirst World Problems\nThe best thing about the 24-hour challenge is that it is impossible to do \nit without realizing immediately afterwards how useless of an activity \ncomplaining truly is.\nIt never makes anything better, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve any purpose besides \nsapping your energy and the energy of those around you, and it makes \nfriends and family screen you out when you call, or run in the other \ndirection when they see you coming.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had to deal with a chronic complainer in your life, then you \nknow what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is true.\nIt is very important to mention that anyone who is dealing with big issues \n(death of a loved one, serious injury/illness, abuse, etc.), please know \nthat this isn\xe2\x80\x99t directed towards you. When I was dealing with some very \nmajor issues in my life, I needed to hang out in the darkness for a while \nbefore I was ready to live in acceptance (or forgiveness, depending on the \nsituation) and move on.\nSpecifically, this post about people who choose negativity and complaining \nwhen dealing with the far less serious \xe2\x80\x9dFirst World Problems\xe2\x80\x9d (FWPs). If \nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what FWPs are, check out the short video below:\n\nIn the future when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with life\xe2\x80\x99s inconveniences (and you \nwill), there really are only two options that make any rational sense:\n1) Do something about the issue\xe2\x80\x93and in the extremely rare instances where \nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t, then\xe2\x80\xa6\n2) Vent and let it go.\nComplaining incessantly to anyone who will listen to us\xe2\x80\x93while \nsimultaneously wallowing in the negativity for an indefinite period of \ntime, without any desire or interest in solving the issue, can no longer be \nan option.\nInstead of complaining, we can choose resiliency.\nInstead of complaining, we can choose thoughts and words that will lead us \ntoward a solution, instead of keeping us stuck in the problem.\nInstead of complaining, we can choose to raise the energy in the room and \nnot drain it.\nInstead of complaining, we can choose to remember all of the blessings that \nwe have.\nMost of all, instead of complaining, we can learn the skill of happiness.\nThere is nothing easy about any of this. If you are currently addicted to \ncomplaining like I was, breaking the vicious cycle may be one of the \nhardest things that you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever do.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let that stop you.\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t about living a complaint-free life, a complaint free year, a \ncomplaint free month, or even a complaint free week.\nThis about challenging yourself to do something that\xe2\x80\x99s potentially \nlife-changing during the only time that matters:\n\nFirst World Problems\xef\xbb\xbf'

Little disclaimer so that \nfeminazis don\'t jump at me calling me a misoginystic pig, I\'m a girl, and \nthis is just something I have noticed a *lot*.\n\nI\'m pretty sure you\'ve all seen these "inspirational" pictures of sunsets \nor a nice peaceful landscape or something like that, and on these pictures \nthere\'s always a quote. It\'s *always* from girls whining about how sad they \nare and how bad their life is-\n"You asked me what\'s wrong and I said \'nothing\'. When you were gone I \nquietly whispered \'Everything...\'"\n"Being sad that I\'m not as beautiful as other girls..." (*cue sad music*)\n"I always feel lonely, even when I\'m in a crowded room."\n"Asking myself why he doesn\'t like me back."\n"She smiles, but inside she\'s crying."\n"Not being able to trust anyone."\n"It\'s okay if you let me down, I\'m used to it anyways."\n"You broke my heart once, since then I have trust issues. I\'m wearing a \nfake smile ever since."\n"Girls are so strong- they pretend to smile when really they are hurting."\nOr my absolute favorite: "A girl\'s biggest lie: \'I\'m fine\'."\n\nI mean seriously, I know that depression is an illness that can happen to \n*anyone*, no matter how rich they are and no matter how many things they \nhave, and people with actual *real* depression have my sympathy.\nBut people who just sit around all day making posts about how sad and \nlonely they are because they don\'t have a boyfriend or because their crush \ndoesn\'t like them back or because "There aren\'t any good men in this world \nanymore, everyone is just out to hurt me"  or because they are too stubborn \nor too "strong" as they call it to tell anyone how sad they or just simply \nbecause they are girls are should please gtfo the internet and try to \nunderstand what "suffering" *really* means.\n\nAlso I think it\'s really sexist- they portray all girls as weak and whiny \nvictims who always break down at the smallest things, it makes me so angry.\xef\xbb\xbf'

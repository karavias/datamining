aS"After being on YouTube for 2 years now, I know how much hate people can \ngive to me when reading these kinds of comments but maybe someone may be \nnicer. My dream is to be an actor and i like to dance in public, but i cant \nget in performing school, and i just got 1,653 subs, which is pretty \nimpressive to me, but I'll never get noticed with these numbers. If someone \nwould have the heart just to give this a thumbs up and spend all of 30 \nseconds watching a vid, it would mean the world. Thank you all"

aS"I'm sorry but there has to be something going on with this. Two months ago \nmany people reported that there were zero dislikes. I don't care how good a \nvideo is, there is no way it can get over a hundred thousand likes without \nany dislikes at all. Either these people are lying or that button got \nhacked. Besides now it's over 7,000 dislikes which is small in proportion \nbut there's no way it was all in the last few month."

aS'The entire "blowing someone\'s mind" thing:\nIf roses are red and violets are blue, then by the commutative property, \nthe color violet is actually blue, and what two colors make violet? Red and \nblue, which means you need red to make violet, and since violet is actually \nblue, that means you need red to make blue. But what makes red? The past \ntense of *read*, because the word you read more than any other word in this \nequation: blue. You *read blue*, creating violet. And because violets are \nactually blue, that proves that not only did I just blow your mind, but \neverything you just *red* (past tense) actually just *blue* your mind.\n                                                                                     \n--Ryan Higa (June 19, 2013)\xef\xbb\xbf'

p550
aS'Oh god, I had to write it down on paper then write it on my phone, well \nhere you go\n\nIf roses are red and violets are blue then by the commutative property the \ncolour blue is actually violet, and what two colours make violet? Red and \nblue which means you need red to make violet and since violet is actually \nblue, it means you need red to make blue; but what makes red? The past \ntense of read because the word you read more than any other word so far in \nthis equation? Blue, you read blue creating violet, and because violets are \nactually blue it proves that not only did I just blow your mind but \neverything you just Red (past tense) actually Blue your Mind.\n\nxD this took me long so a +1 would be appreciated. Thanks\xef\xbb\xbf'

p1321
aS'By the commutative property, a=b and b=a which means that blue=violet. And \nwhat two colours make violet? Red and blue. Which means you need red to \nmake violet. But since violent = blue, you need red to make blue? But what \nmakes red? The past tense of read. Because the word you read more than any \nother word in the equation , is blue. You "read blue" creating violet. And \nbecause violet = blue, it proves that not only did I blew your mind, I BLUE \nyour mind'

aS"After Robin William's death and my own personal hatred of people who don't \ntell people how much their worth until they're already gone, I decided on a \npretty similar motto. Everything you would say at a wake after someone has \npassed, should be said as often as possible. On their birthdays, during \nholidays, and everyday if you can. Don't wait until you're at a wake to \ncelebrate someone's life, especially people who suffer from mental illness \nand disorders and need to be reminded they're worth fighting for. I'm glad \nyou shared this with us, I'm definitely going to keep it in mind. \xef\xbb\xbf"

p225
aS"Well I wouldn't say its your campaign as Existentialism draws back to \nSocrates who questioned the the very zest of life comes from our finality. \nIf nothing died, 'living' would would mean nothing. \nTruth is you have a finite amount of time available and that every moment \nyou escape sudden death you are in fact closer to it. The more you connect \nwith this idea, the more each moment of your life will mean to you. And if \nyou're not narcissistic, you'll see others experience the same thing. \nConnecting with mortality is the essence of good living, as to live is to \ncare about living. \xef\xbb\xbf"

aS'The sad part is I actually know of someone who was literally dying. (long \nterm, cancer, no necessarily tomorrow would be the next day type of thing) \n\nProblem is he openly acted like a jerk, to which I responded rather \nnegatively. It was actually annoying because people expected me to simply \nturn a blind eye to it all. \n\nJust as you should treat other people like their dying, act as if you are \ndying. I think that is a big message here.\xef\xbb\xbf'
p306
aS'I swear sometimes people just dislike a video just for the sake of \ndisliking the video. \n\nTheir mind just thinks,\n"Oh, this video is cool. No one disliked it. I\'ll be the first one!"\xef\xbb\xbf'

But knowing the person \nis dying you would say "It\'s okay, it was just an accident"... so instead \nif treat people the way you want to be treated... even though sometimes \nthat works.... Treat people like they\'re dying... and if this spread around \nthe world.... I bet no one would still listen because people out hear are \nselfish and doesn\'t care about anything... but...

They were hilarious, and they boosted my confidence and \nhappiness. I amm just now tonight getting back into niga higa. I watched \nnigahigas- draw my life. It just tore open my mind and gave me a whole new \nperspective on life.\n\n\nOk, so idk if ur gonna read this, among millions of subscribers and \ncomments, but i wrote this to my girlfriend who suffers from depression. \nAnd i too suffer the same curse. We keep eachother strong. Thats alil \nbesides the point lmaoo, really tho, you have helped me thru many tough \ntimes and helped me develop into who i am today. Nigahiga, your videos, \nalthough comedic and funny, have serious meaning, and have been an \ninspiration to me and countless others. Infact, many times i have thought \nabout befriending u in person because you are a very very awesome person \nlmaoo. (Not tryna sound creepy or anything).

I always try to be nice to ppl even if they are rude to me cause \nit's not worth getting mad at them but if I really don't like them I ignore \nthem. Ignoring them causes less stress and frustration. This is a very good \nmessage and more ppl should follow your good example.\xef\xbb\xbf"

Those health conditions actually led to Cash's death several months \nlater. But Johnny Cash will never be forgotten; he will be remembered as \none of the greatest musical legends of all time. Thank you Johnny, for such \nan emotional, yet amazing cover! And most importantly, thank you for the \nmany memorable songs that you have left behind for your fans (then and now) \nto enjoy during your legendary career :)\nR.I.P.

I can't begin to say how much, \nespecially with Johnny Cash. I hurt myself every day--psychological harm, \nor attempts at it--to try to feel again, and it never works, it never \nchanges. And just like the man in this song, everyone I know.... Goes away \nin the end. I have two friends... One of them I'm in love with, the other \nis hard to put up with (but at least he's there).\n\nA sample from me and my best friend (who I'm in love with)'s latest \nconversation: \n\nAbby...

If you \ndon't like JC's version, then respect that this was his dying song (I \nbelieve, at least) and it was his heart, his soul, he was pouring into it. \nIt may be a cover of a song already made, but this version is so different \nyet so powerful and beautiful I consider it it's own song.\xef\xbb\xbf"

The Nine Inch Nail's version is good, but to me the Johnny Cash \nversion is great. Mr. Cash's version was more harmonious with a well timed \nflow and interrupt like life. Many people I have talked with on this song \nagree with that position, and that we could easily see our own video to \nthat song.

In our times you can \nfind everything you want on internet so don't tell me your bullshit rights \ncause your knowledge about music is the same as knowledge of my far \ngrandmother about Messerchmitt Bf 109. Check wikipedia and all J.Cash \nmainsites. Both of them are great artist but how an ashole like You can \nassign something to wrong person ? It's covered song , everyone knows that \n.

It\'s not a "Cover" to me.\nMusicians have the spirit of music in them.\nI see it that Trent Reznor and Johnny Cash worked together on this song. \nJust at different times, not knowing fate would bring the words and \nperformance together, that has touched us all to the core. But that\'s the \nmagic of music and life itself.\nThank you Mr. Reznor and Mr. Cash\nLove forever.\xef\xbb\xbf'

p356
aS"Cash is a legend in his own right but it's clear this cover only got the \nattention it did due to its release and proximity to Cash's death.  It's a \nfantastic rendition but the original is far better.  Reznor performs the \nsong with passion and pain.  This cover seems like a convenient one-off.  \nThe cover stands on its own merits but it's not like Cash redefined the \nsong or anything.\xef\xbb\xbf"
